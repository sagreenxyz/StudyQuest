      "question": "Diseases that are seen only occasionally, and usually without geographic concentration, are called________________ diseases.",
      "options": ["sporadic", "epidemic", "endemic", "pandemic"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Sporadic diseases occur infrequently and irregularly, without a specific geographic concentration. Endemic diseases are constantly present in a population within a particular geographic region. Epidemic diseases are those for which a larger than expected number of cases occurs in a short time within a geographic region. Pandemic diseases are epidemics that occur on a worldwide scale.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A point source spread occurs when a common source, like contaminated food, infects many individuals over a brief period. Intermittent common source spread involves exposure over longer, irregular periods. Continuous common source spread involves prolonged exposure. Propagated spread is from person-to-person transmission.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "West Nile virus is generally considered an emerging disease in many regions where it was previously unknown, rather than a re-emerging one (which implies a resurgence after a period of decline). Malaria, drug-resistant gonorrhea, and drug-resistant tuberculosis are often cited as re-emerging due to various factors like waning immunity, drug resistance, or changes in public health measures.",
