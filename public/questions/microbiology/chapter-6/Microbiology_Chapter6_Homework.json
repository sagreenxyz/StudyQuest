    {
      "id": "mc-ch6-hw-1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "subject": "Microbiology",
      "chapter": "Chapter 6",
      "topic": "Viruses, Viroids, and Prions",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "Viruses are nonliving infectious agents.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "True. Viruses are considered nonliving because they are acellular and cannot reproduce or carry out metabolic functions without a host cell."
    },

      "id": "mc-ch6-hw-2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "subject": "Microbiology",
      "chapter": "Chapter 6",
      "topic": "Viruses, Viroids, and Prions",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "Viruses only contain RNA.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "False. A virus can have either DNA or RNA as its genetic material, but not both."
    },

      "id": "mc-ch6-hw-3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "subject": "Microbiology",
      "chapter": "Chapter 6",
      "topic": "Viruses, Viroids, and Prions",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "Viruses are known as infectious agents because they need a host to gain ATP and to reproduce.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "True. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they rely entirely on the host cell's machinery for energy (ATP) and replication."
    },

      "id": "mc-ch6-hw-4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",

      "chapter": "Chapter 6",
      "topic": "Viruses, Viroids, and Prions",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "Viroids are only found in plants.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "False. While most known viroids are plant pathogens, some have been discovered in fungi as well."

      "question": "A prion is comprised of a protein and RNA.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "False. Prions are infectious agents composed entirely of a misfolded protein; they do not contain any nucleic acid (RNA or DNA)."
