      ],
      "explanation": "The body maintains this constant flow of fluid through the tissues and carries materials to and from the cells by means of hydrostatic pressure and colloidal osmotic pressure. Chemical and physiologic buffer systems and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are not directly involved in maintaining a constant flow of fluid through the tissues and carries materials to and from the cells. Chemical and physiologic buffer systems are important mechanisms for maintaining the blood pH within an acceptable range for life. The renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system is a complex hormonal system that corrects for hypovolemia through a negative feedback mechanism."

        "Diffusion",
        "Osmosis",
        "Facilitated diffusion",
        "Pinocytosis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In facilitated diffusion, membrane transporters assist particles with the crossing of the membrane. Cell membrane transporters are not involved in diffusion, osmosis, or pinocytosis. In simple diffusion, particles move outward in all directions from an area of greater concentration of particles to an area of lesser concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area with a low solute concentration to an area with a high solute concentration. In pinocytosis, large molecules attach themselves to the cell membrane, whereby the cell engulfs them encased in a vacuole. In this cavity, nutrient particles are carried across the cell membrane and into the cell. Once inside the cell, the vacuole opens, and cell enzymes metabolize the particles. Test-Taking Tip: Attempt to select the answer that is most complete and includes the other answers within it. For example, a stem might read, \"A child's intelligence is influenced by what?\" and three options might be genetic inheritance, environmental factors, and past experiences. The fourth option might be multiple factors, which is a more inclusive choice and therefore the correct answer."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The walls of capillaries are thin and porous. Larger particles such as plasma protein molecules cannot pass through the small pores of the capillary membrane. Water molecules and small particles, including electrolytes and various nutrient constituents, can move freely through the capillary membrane."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Plasma proteins (called colloids) exert COP to maintain the integrity of the blood volume. Glucose, anions, and cations are not responsible for maintaining integrity of the blood volume by exerting colloidal osmotic pressure. Glucose are small organic compounds that produce movement of water in uncharacteristic high concentration scenarios. Cations and anions are electrolytes that maintain electrical neutrality."

      "explanation": "Dehydration presents special concerns among older adults. Age-associated physiologic changes to the hypothalamus and renal system, such as an increase in urine volume and decrease in fluid resorption, coupled with a decline in fluid intake, make this population vulnerable to chronic hypohydration. Polydipsia, or excessive thirst and drinking, and psychotropic drugs are risk factors for water intoxication, not dehydration."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "High fluid intake (via breast milk or breast milk substitute) is critical during infancy because an infant’s body content of water is particularly high (approximately 70% to 75% of their total body weight) and because a relatively large amount of this body water is outside of the cells and thus is more easily lost. Breast milk does not have a diuretic effect. A relatively large amount of an infant’s body water is outside of the cells. Infants being prone to diseases is not a factor that makes high fluid intake critical during infancy."

      ],
      "explanation": "Cold temperatures and altitude result in elevated respiratory water loss, hypoxia- or cold-induced diuresis, and increased energy expenditure, all of which raise water needs. Body temperature and environmental temperature decrease with altitude. Therefore high body temperature and sweating are not factors that increase the body’s requirement for water in high altitude."

      "explanation": "The adequate intake value of total water for pregnant women is 3.0 L. This includes 2.7 L from beverages and 0.7 L from food. A pregnant woman needs more water than an adult woman who in not pregnant. Consuming less than 3 L of water per day is inadequate and more than 3 L is excessive.

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Metabolic alkalosis is defined as a pH greater than 7.45. Metabolic alkalosis is seen with extensive vomiting in which a significant amount of hydrochloric acid is lost and bicarbonate is secreted. Metabolic acidosis is caused by a variety of conditions that cause the excess accumulation of acids in the body or by a significant loss of bicarbonate. Respiratory acidosis is caused by an accumulation of carbon dioxide. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation and an excess loss of carbon dioxide. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

      "question": "Which pH level reflects metabolic acidosis?",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Metabolic acidosis is demonstrated by a pH level less than 7.35. Therefore, 7.15 is the correct answer. The pH is a negative mathematical factor; therefore the higher the hydrogen ion content, the lower the pH number. A pH level of 7.75, 7.55, and 7.35 would not be indicative of acidosis. Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely. Example: If the answer you are seeking is directed to a specific treatment and all but one option deal with signs and symptoms, you would be correct in choosing the treatment-specific option."

      "explanation": "The gastrointestinal fluids and blood in circulation are both part of the extracellular fluid (ECF). These fluids are isotonic, which means that they are in a state of equal osmotic pressure from equivalent concentrations of electrolytes and other solute particles. Extracellular fluid is not hypotonic."

      "explanation": "The capillary fluid shift mechanism uses a combination of membrane transport methods to perform a balancing act between opposing fluid pressures. It is one of the body’s most important controls for maintaining homeostasis. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration. Diffusion applies to the particles in a solution. Facilitated diffusion follows the same principles as simple diffusion but also includes membrane transporters that assist particles with the crossing of the membrane.

Cations are positively charged ions and include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. The constant balance between electrolytes maintains the electrochemical and cell membrane potentials. Several drugs interact with the body's fluid balance, such as diuretics which work directly to reduce the amount of fluid in the body, or psychiatric medications that may have side effects that affect fluid balance.

      "explanation": "Psychogenic polydipsia is a condition caused by antipsychotics. It causes dry mouth. People who have psychogenic polydipsia usually consume an excessive amount of water at a rapid rate. The body cannot correct for the acute dilation of the blood, and hyponatremia ensues. Consuming too little sodium may lead to hyponatremia, but because the patient has a history of psychogenic polydipsia, the most likely cause is consuming too much water. Long-term corticosteroid use increases the excretion of potassium, not sodium. Taking too high a dose of diuretics can also lead to hypokalemia, but there is no indication that the patient is taking a diuretic."

In this example, osmosis would move water into the cell, where the concentration of the glucose solute is higher. Osmosis would also move glucose, but not electrolytes, out of the cell. It would not maintain the disequilibrium nor would it move water out of the cell.

      "explanation": "Glucose is a small organic compound that diffuses freely in and out of the various fluid compartments but does not influence the movement of water unless present in abnormally large concentrations. Such a situation occurs in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or when large amounts of glucose being excreted in the urine cause an abnormal osmotic diuresis or excess water output. This would not result from diuretic use, reactive hypoglycemia, or a high-carbohydrate diet in the absence of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question. ph 140"

      "explanation": "Dehydration presents special concerns among older adult patients. The hypothalamus is the regulatory center for thirst, hunger, body temperature, water balance, and blood pressure. Age-associated physiologic changes to the hypothalamus and renal system, such as an increased urine volume and a decrease in fluid reabsorption, make the older adult population vulnerable to chronic hypohydration. Older adult individuals exhibit a decreased thirst sensation and a decreased desire to consume fluids when they are dehydrated; however, the mechanisms of thirst perception are not clearly defined. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think that they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The statement requiring correction is \"If the body’s pH is too high, the kidneys secrete hydrogen ions.\" The high pH indicates fluids are alkaline. Hydrogen ion secretion is not a compensatory response because secretion would worsen the alkalinity of the fluids. If the body’s pH is too high, the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume will decrease to retain acidic carbon dioxide and restore the body’s pH. If the body’s pH is too low, the kidneys will secrete hydrogen ions to restore alkalinity. If the pH is too low, the respiratory rate will increase to release acidic carbon dioxide and restore the pH."

      "explanation": "The hypothalamus is the regulatory center for thirst, hunger, body temperature, water balance, and blood pressure. Age-associated physiologic changes to the hypothalamus and renal system can cause elderly individuals to have overall decreased thirst sensation and reduced fluid intake when they are dehydrated compared with younger adults.

Angiotensin | is an inactive peptide hormone that is the precursor to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is an active hormone that constricts blood vessels and stimulates the release of aldosterone. Both actions lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone a hormone of the adrenal glands that acts on the distal nephron tubule to stimulate the reabsorption of sodium in an ion exchange with potassium; the aldosterone mechanism is essentially a sodium-conserving mechanism, but it also indirectly conserves water because water absorption follows sodium resorption."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In facilitated diffusion, membrane transporters assist particles with the crossing of the membrane. Cell membrane transporters are not involved in diffusion, osmosis, or pinocytosis. In simple diffusion, particles move outward in all directions from an area of greater concentration of particles to an area of lesser concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area with a low solute concentration to an area with a high solute concentration. In pinocytosis, large molecules attach themselves to the cell membrane, whereby the cell engulfs them encased in a vacuole. In this cavity, nutrient particles are carried across the cell membrane and into the cell. Once inside the cell, the vacuole opens, and cell enzymes metabolize the particles. Test-Taking Tip: Attempt to select the answer that is most complete and includes the other answers within it. For example, a stem might read, \"A child's intelligence is influenced by what?\" and three options might be genetic inheritance, environmental factors, and past experiences. The fourth option might be multiple factors, which is a more inclusive choice and therefore the correct answer."

Breast milk does not have a diuretic effect. A relatively large amount of an infant’s body water is outside of the cells. Infants being prone to diseases is not a factor that makes high fluid intake critical during infancy."
