      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient admitted with uncontrolled chronic hypertension and a blood clot in the lower left leg will be put on medication to treat both the cardiac and clotting conditions. Some prescribed medications may interact with nutrients in food or dietary supplements, thereby creating a drug—nutrient interaction. Overnutrition results from excess nutrient and/or energy intake over time and the use of excessive amounts of dietary supplements. Individuals suffering from chronic illness are at an increased risk for food insecurity independent of their socioeconomic status, which may need to be addressed but is not the priority risk factor. Metabolites are the product of various reactions as a result of chemical reactions and energy production in the body; increased metabolites are not the priority risk factor for this patient."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Amino acids are nitrogen-bearing compounds that form the structural units of protein; after digestion, amino acids are available for synthesis of required proteins. Fatty acids are the building blocks of lipids, which help build the central fat substance that is necessary in all cell membranes, and promote the transport of fat- soluble nutrients throughout the body. Dietary fiber helps to regulate the passage of food material through the gastrointestinal tract and it influences the absorption of nutrients. The primary function of protein is tissue building. Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the question that was asked? If the question stem asks \"why,' be sure the response you have chosen is the reason. If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural responses. Many times, checking to make sure the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal the correct answer."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The nurse will focus on health promotion for the patient newly diagnosed with heart disease. Health promotion, which includes nutritional intake, is the active engagement in behaviors or programs that advance positive well-being. Optimal nutrition occurs when a person receives and uses adequate nutrients obtained from a varied and balanced diet of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and water; this will be important for the patient, but it is included in health promotion. Preventive health care involves identifying risk factors in advance that increase a person’s chances of developing a particular health problem; because the patient already has heart disease, it is too late for this intervention. DRIs are reference values for the nutrient intake needs of healthy individuals based on sex and age; monitoring them is less important than health promotion. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

This change of emphasis resulted in the DRIs project. Since 1941, the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) have been the authoritative source for setting standards for the minimum amounts of nutrients necessary to protect almost all people against the risk for nutrient deficiency and this remains true today.

The tips recommend switching to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk, comparing sodium content in foods, and drinking water instead of sugary drinks. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Providing a patient-centered approach, the nurse should review the popular weight-loss diet to ensure that the general dietary needs are still being met in accordance with the dietary reference intake recommendations before supporting the patient’s decision. Dismissing a dietary preference in favor of a meal plan may promote patient resistance. Encouraging the diet in addition to increased physical activity before review of the diet is not a safe practice."
