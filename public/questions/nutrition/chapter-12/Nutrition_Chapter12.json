      "options": [
        "It diagnoses malnutrition.",
        "It can be used anywhere.",
        "It assesses dietary intake."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The MNA is a highly reliable tool that is used to evaluate risk for malnutrition in older adults residing in nursing homes. The MNA is not used to diagnose malnutrition; rather, it is used in the nursing home setting, not anywhere, and it does not just specifically assess dietary intake. It assesses other parameters that can identify risk factors for malnutrition."

      "question": "— Which age is forecasted to be the median in the United States by the year 2060?",
      "options": [
        "18 years",
        "38 years",
        "43 years",
        "@ 65 years"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The median age will increase from 38 to 43 by 2060, with women outnumbering men in the eldest groups. Eighteen, 38, and 65 are not the forecasted average median age of the U.S. population by the year 2060. Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives that you know are incorrect, and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem, read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response."

        "Poor nutrition",
        "Decline in insulin production",
        "Decreased metabolism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "As people age, the production and secretion of hydrochloric acid decreases and may result in inadequate vitamin B 39 absorption. Poor nutrition is not a physiologic change. During the aging process, the common decline in insulin production or insulin sensitivity may result in elevated blood glucose levels and diabetes. Decreased metabolism is a naturally occurring process in aging that is responsible for reduced cell metabolism and changes in body composition. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

      "explanation": "Genetic potential is one of the factors that govern the overall physical growth and maturity of the human body, which level off during the early adult years. Personality development and marriage influence psychosocial development, not the physical growth, of an individual throughout adult years. Family income influences socioeconomic status, not the physical growth, of an individual during adult years."

      "explanation": "Congregate nutrition services are most appropriate for a physically active older adult who is socioeconomically stable. Socioeconomic stability does not impact the ability to participate in the nutrition program. It is a service that provides adults who are older than 60 years of age and their spouses with nutritionally sound meals in senior centers and other public or private facilities. Home-delivered meals are for older adults who are ill or disabled and cannot travel to the community centers. SNAP issues benefits to any primary head of household at or below 130% of the federal poverty line. The commodity supplemental food program is for individuals older than 60 years of age who are at a socioeconomic disadvantage. The program is intended to provide food packages to supplement a diet with foods that are high in nutrition."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Consumption of \"empty calorie\" foods should be decreased to help address the decline in the metabolic rate and avoid obesity and other health issues. The need for supplementation with vitamin B 19 is caused by reduced hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, not a change in metabolic rate. Carbohydrates should comprise approximately 45% to 60% of total kilocalories. An increased need for vitamin D as one ages is caused by decreased synthesis, not a change in the metabolic rate."

      "explanation": "Decreased hand function is a common condition in older adults and may interfere with the ability to prepare food. Sarcopenia is a loss of lean tissue mass related to aging. Not all chronic illnesses result in an older adult’s inability to prepare food. Decreased hand-eye coordination occurs as a result of the overall decreased hand function and by itself is not considered a common condition.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The decrease in hypothalamic function reduces thirst in older adults, which results in an increased risk for dehydration. An increased loss of skeletal muscle mass occurs as a result of inadequate dietary protein metabolism and physical activity. Unintentional weight gain results from nutritional problems. The increased risk for osteoporosis occurs significantly with age and is a result of poor bone health. Some contributing factors include inadequate vitamin D and calcium intake."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The older adult client who experiences a decline in taste and smell acuity is at the greatest risk for food-borne illness because the client may be unable to recognize spoiled food. Frequent illnesses in the older adult are a result of malnourishment rather than the effects of aging. Poor bone health occurs when bone mineral density is low and bones become brittle. Many factors contribute to poor bone health, including inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake, which are not related to a decline in taste and smell acuity. Unintentional weight loss may be a sign of malnutrition or another disease process that is not necessarily caused by a decline in taste and smell acuity."

      "explanation": "A health care team can advocate for an older adult who is at risk for malnutrition by assisting in the application process for nutritional assistance and helping set up the older adult’s involvement so they can receive adequate nutrition. Setting up transportation will not help the older adult client at a socioeconomic disadvantage to purchase food. Counseling the family and consulting a community center are not as effective options as helping with the application for ensuring the client receives adequate nutritional assistance. Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are incorrect."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "There is a high risk for deficiency of vitamin B j2 as individuals age as a result of decreased gastric acid production and secretion decreasing absorption of the vitamin. Physical changes may alter food intake of older adults leading to micronutrient deficiencies, but this does not provide the best explanation for the need for vitamin B 2 injections for this client. Lack of sunlight affects vitamin D, not vitamin B 12. Foods fortified with vitamin B 1) or vitamin B j2 supplementation should be used by individuals over age 50 years, but this response does not provide an explanation for the physical changes that result in a need for vitamin B j2 injections."

Physical growth and maturity are governed by genetic potential and level off in the early adult years; it is not complete at adulthood, nor does it stop at the end of adolescence.

      "explanation": "Depression is a common psychiatric condition seen in older adults and the leading cause of unintentional weight loss, so asking the client about overwhelming loneliness and sadness, which can indicate depression, would be most important. Asking about the ability to afford rent and food may be helpful but would not be the most important question to ask in determining the cause of the weight loss. Sensory changes including taste and smell can contribute to a poor appetite but would not be the most important in determining the cause of the unintentional weight loss. Asking whether the client has thought about exercising to help increase appetite would not elicit information to determine the possible cause of the unintentional weight loss."

Basal metabolic rate does decline 1% to 2% per decade, but an increased rate of decline begins earlier for men than women, so this is an incorrect statement. The basal metabolic rate begins a more rapid decline for men at age 40 and women at age 50, so stating that the rate declines more rapidly for women is incorrect.

      "explanation": "A lack of sufficient nourishment is a primary nutrition problem for older adults. Physical activity is not a nutritional problem, but a lack of it can lead to unnecessary weight gain. Overeating can lead to obesity, which is on the rise, but it is not as common a problem in the older adult. The gastrointestinal muscles do weaken, which contributes to the decreased absorption and bioavailability of nutrients, but this is a lower-priority concern in the nurse’s assessment."

Insulin response to glucose in the bloodstream is inadequate to maintain euglycemia and needs further investigation. Because the patient is overweight, the initial recommendation would be weight management in the form of increasing physical activity. Insulin therapy is not appropriate for prediabetes treatment. Physical activity declines with age, so weight management through regular physical activity for prediabetes, along with balanced meals and snacks, rather than oral antidiabetics, is recommended to avoid hyperglycemia and potentially delay or avoid the onset of type 2 diabetes. Because it is already known that the patient is overweight and there is a confirmed elevation in glucose level, it would not be appropriate to wait for a subsequent appointment and reassessment to provide basic guidance such as increasing physical activity."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Depression is the leading cause of unintentional weight loss in older adults. Impaired physical function can be a contributing factor for unintentional weight loss in some instances, but it is not the leading cause. Unintentional weight loss is a symptom in an older adult diagnosed with failure to thrive. Failure to thrive is generally multifactorial and caused by a combination of chronic diseases associated with impaired physical function, malnutrition, depression, and cognitive impairment. Limited access to health care contributes to a higher risk for poor health and death, but it is not the leading cause of weight loss in older adults."

      "question": "Which age is forecasted to be the median in the United States by the year 2060?",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The median age will increase from 38 to 43 by 2060, with women outnumbering men in the eldest groups. Eighteen, 38, and 65 are not the forecasted average median age of the U.S. population by the year 2060. Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives that you know are incorrect, and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem, read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The decrease in hypothalamic function reduces thirst in older adults, which results in an increased risk for dehydration. An increased loss of skeletal muscle mass occurs as a result of inadequate dietary protein metabolism and physical activity. Unintentional weight gain results from nutritional problems. The increased risk for osteoporosis occurs significantly with age and is a result of poor bone health. Some contributing factors include inadequate vitamin D and calcium intake."

      "options": [
        "Multiple hormonal changes",
        "Changes in body composition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "At approximately age 30, a gradual loss of functioning cells begins, resulting in reduced cell metabolism. Multiple hormonal changes cause a variety of issues at different ages that impact health but are not implicated in relation to cell metabolism. Changes in body composition also occur because of the gradual loss of functioning cells, so this is not a pathophysiologic basis for reduced cell metabolism. A decreased bodily demand for energy is not related to reduced cell metabolism as one ages but rather the result of it."
