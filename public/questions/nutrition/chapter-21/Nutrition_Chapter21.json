      "options": [
        "Ketonuria"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "During the early stages of chronic kidney failure, the kidneys are unable to reabsorb water or properly concentrate urine. Therefore large amounts of dilute urine are produced, called polyuria. As the disease progresses, urine production declines. Anuria occurs when there is no urine output and oliguria when there are abnormally small amounts of it. Ketonuria is the presence of ketone bodies in the urine."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Azotemia describes elevated blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid levels. Polyuria is the production of large amounts of dilute urine. Protein-energy malnutrition is a common complication of protein catabolism in patients with chronic kidney disease. Metabolic acidosis is caused by the accumulation of phosphate, sulfate, and organic acids in the blood. Test-Taking Tip: Sometimes the reading of a question in the middle or toward the end of an exam may trigger your mind with the answer or provide an important clue to an earlier question."

      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "During the diuretic phase, patients may lose excessive electrolytes. Losses of both sodium and potassium (2 to 3 g/day of each) should be replaced during this phase. During anuria or oliguria, electrolytes may need to be restricted due to accumulation in the blood and increased risk for hyperkalemia. During recovery, kidney function gradually improves, and intake of nutrients may normalize."

Carbohydrates should not be restricted. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Rely on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "In chronic kidney disease, a concentration of materials (e.g., phosphate, sulfate, organic acids) is produced by the metabolism of nutrients. Without appropriate filtering by the failing kidneys, these materials accumulate in the blood, thereby causing metabolic acidosis. Ketosis, alkalosis, and ketoacidosis occur as a result of different imbalances."

      "explanation": "Blockage of tubules caused by cellular debris from tissue trauma or urinary failure with backup retention of filtrate materials explains the occurrence of oliguria in the patient with acute kidney injury. Accumulation of uremic toxins not completely removed by dialysis is a cause of uremia in the acute kidney injury patient. Diminished ability of failing kidneys to synthesize adequate amounts of erythropoietin often leads to anemia in the acute kidney injury patient. Decreased ability of kidneys to excrete potassium in an amount equal to that absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract leads to excessive potassium levels."

Infections, including urinary tract infections, can lead to chronic disease and formation of kidney stones. Other causes of obstruction, such as prostatic hypertrophy, which blocks urinary tract drainage, may lead to general tissue damage and kidney disease. Various environmental agents, animal venom, certain plants, heavy metals, and some drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and radiographic contrast dye, are nephrotoxic and can cause kidney damage."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The primary risk factors for uric acid stone formation is acidic urine, excess urinary excretion of uric acid, and low urine volume. Hyperuricosuria may result from an impairment in purine metabolism. Purine is a nitrogen product of protein metabolism and forms uric acid. Cystine stones are the result of a genetic defect in the renal reabsorption process of the amino acid cystine. Struvite stones, also called infection stones, are primarily caused by urinary tract infections. Calcium stones occur from the supersaturation of kidney stone material in the urine. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Nephrolithiasis is the medical term for kidney stones. Low dietary calcium intake is a risk for calcium oxalate stone formation. The patient should be encouraged to consume 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day and balance their intake throughout the day. Citrate and potassium are helpful in solubilizing calcium salts and preventing stone formation. Patients should be encouraged to consume 4.7 g of potassium per day. High sodium intake increases the amount of calcium excretion in the urine, thereby increasing the risk for stone formation. Excessive protein intake from animal sources is a risk factor for stone formation. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors.

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The diet of a patient receiving hemodialysis is important for maintaining biochemical balance. Calcium intake should not exceed 2 g/day, including the amount received through food, dietary supplements, and medications. Protein-energy malnutrition is a major concern for people on hemodialysis. For most people on dialysis, a protein allowance of at least 1.2 g/kg is ideal to prevent protein malnutrition. It is recommended to limit sodium intake to 2.4 g/day, not 3 g/day, to control body fluid retention and hypertension. To prevent potassium accumulation, which can cause cardiac problems, potassium intake should be limited to less than 2.4 g/day. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be very helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

The nurse would educate the patient on how to perform peritoneal dialysis as the patient introduces the dialysate solution directly into the peritoneal cavity. The access for peritoneal dialysis is a permanent catheter in the peritoneal cavity, not a vascular access as with hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis allows for mobility. Hemodialysis typically is required three times per week and lasts about 3 to 4 hours. Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Nephrolithiasis is the medical term for kidney stones. Low dietary calcium intake is a risk for calcium oxalate stone formation. The patient should be encouraged to consume 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day and balance their intake throughout the day. Citrate and potassium are helpful in solubilizing calcium salts and preventing stone formation. Patients should be encouraged to consume 4.7 g of potassium per day. High sodium intake increases the amount of calcium excretion in the urine, thereby increasing the risk for stone formation. Excessive protein intake from animal sources is a risk factor for stone formation. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question. pp. 408-409"

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Peritoneal dialysis is a form of dialysis where the peritoneal membrane serves as a filter in which metabolic wastes can pass into the dialysate for removal from the body. The nurse would educate the patient on how to perform peritoneal dialysis as the patient introduces the dialysate solution directly into the peritoneal cavity. The access for peritoneal dialysis is a permanent catheter in the peritoneal cavity, not a vascular access as with hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis allows for mobility. Hemodialysis typically is required three times per week and lasts about 3 to 4 hours. Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be wrong and lose precious points. pp. 403-404"

This section usually reabsorbs glucose and amino acids. Next, the remaining 20% of fluid enters the loop of Henle. Next, the secretion of hydrogen ions occurs as needed in the distal tubule to control the acid-base balance. Lastly, concentrated urine is produced in the collecting tubule section."

      "explanation": "CKD is staged by disease severity, and treatment should be based on the level of progression. In a patient with stage 5 CKD, sodium should be restricted to <2.4 g/day to control interdialytic fluid gain. In stage 5 CKD, the patient receiving RRT would reduce and substitute saturated fat with healthier fat sources. When a patient is receiving RRT, protein intake should be 1.1 to 1.5 g/kg of body weight per day. If the patient had stage 5 CKD but was not receiving RRT, the protein intake recommendation would be 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day. If the patient is receiving hemodialysis, potassium intake should be 2 to 4 g/day, or 40 mg/kg of body weight per day.

To find protein intake requirements, the nurse converts the patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms (180/2.2 = 82) and multiplies by the protein cofactors (82 x 0.6 = 49 and 82 x 0.8 = 66). The patient should consume 49 to 66 g of protein daily. Daily protein intake of 16 to 22 g would not be enough for this patient to maintain tissue integrity, while daily protein intakes of 82 to 106 g or 108 to 144 g would be excessive for this patient. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration.
