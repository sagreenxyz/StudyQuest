      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fruit and dairy products are sources of naturally occurring sugars, including fructose and lactose. Cakes and cookies contain added sugars, not naturally occurring sugars. Whole grains and cereals, as well as legumes and rice, contain complex carbohydrates such as dietary fiber and are not sources of naturally occurring sugars. pp. 13-14"

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Carbohydrates must be broken down into monosaccharides before they can be absorbed into circulation. Chemical digestion of carbohydrates is completed in the small intestine. Stomach acid and enzymes halt amylase action. Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth and progresses through the gastrointestinal tract."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The DRIs recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake come from carbohydrate foods; this translates to 225 to 325 g of carbohydrates for a 2000 kcal/day diet. Further, 75 to 125 g and 150 to 200 g are too low, and 350 to 450 g of carbohydrates is too high."

      "explanation": "Polysaccharides, including starch and certain fibers, are complex carbohydrates. Beans are an example of a food containing complex carbohydrates. Milk and carrots contain disaccharides, which are classified as simple carbohydrates. Peaches and other fruits contain monosaccharides, which are also considered simple carbohydrates. Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important. Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong response. No real absolutes exist in life; however, every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care."

      "explanation": "Complex carbohydrates may provide fiber in addition to glucose. Although some complex carbohydrates, such as fiber, are not digestible, others are digested and broken down into glucose. Disaccharides are composed of two single-sugar units but are considered simple carbohydrates. Simple, not complex, carbohydrates circulate freely in the blood and are the main source of energy for the brain."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Although carbohydrates provide energy, fiber, and sweeteners, the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates is the supply of energy. Carbohydrate sweeteners found naturally in some foods are accompanied by essential nutrients; however, this does not describe the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates. Sweeteners provided by carbohydrates do affect blood glucose levels; however, this statement does not clearly describe the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates. Dietary fiber is used by the body for several purposes; however, the provision of dietary fiber is not the real nutrient function of carbohydrates."

      "explanation": "Sugar beets and corn syrup are sources of simple carbohydrates, not complex carbohydrates. Corn, peas, and oatmeal are all good sources of complex carbohydrates. Potatoes are a good source of complex carbohydrates if the skin is eaten as well, because the skin contains a greater concentration of dietary fiber. Hamburger buns and whole-wheat bread are both good sources of complex carbohydrates. Test-Taking Tip: Avoid taking a wild guess at an answer. However, should you feel insecure about a question, eliminate the alternatives that you believe are definitely incorrect, and reread the information given to make sure you understand the intent of the question.

IBS may produce similar symptoms; however, there is no relationship between IBS symptoms and lactose-containing foods. Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the lining of the digestive tract becomes inflamed, producing pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition.

Mechanical digestion comprises chewing, peristalsis, segmentation, and the action of sphincter muscles, which regulate the movement of food from one organ to the next. Nutrient absorption occurs as digested molecules of food, water, and minerals from the diet are taken up for the body’s use and occurs mainly in the small intestine. Metabolism is a set of processes through which absorbed nutrients are used by the body for energy to form and maintain body structures and functions."

Protein is necessary for tissue growth and maintenance, a function that cannot be served by other macronutrients. Rapid fat metabolism produces ketones, which upset the normal acid-base balance of the body. The brain does not store supplies of glucose and is dependent on constant carbohydrate intake; thus, an inadequate supply can lead to brain damage. Osmotic diarrhea is the result of excessive intake of carbohydrates such as sugar alcohols, not the result of inadequate carbohydrate intake. Mineral absorption is reduced when carbohydrates such as dietary fiber are excessive, not with inadequate dietary intake of carbohydrates.

Sugar alcohols do have kilocalories and can raise blood sugar levels.

      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "Nonnutritive sweeteners have no caloric value. Nutritive sweeteners, not nonnutritive, utilize sugar alcohol that slows digestion. The most common sugar alcohol is sorbitol. Nutritive sweeteners are much sweeter than sucrose; therefore the same sweet taste comes from extremely small quantities of the product. Nutritive sweeteners also provide a lower risk for dental caries. Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem, read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response."

      "explanation": "The liver regulates the amount of glucose entering the blood in response to pancreatic hormones. The mouth begins mechanical digestion of carbohydrates by breaking food into smaller pieces and secreting amylase into the saliva to start the process of chemical digestion. The stomach produces acid and enzymes that halt the amylase action. The small intestine secretes intestinal enzymes and collects pancreatic amylase, which continues the breakdown of simple carbohydrates."

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that carbohydrates account for 45% to 65% of total caloric intake. To calculate the recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrates for a patient, the total energy intake must be multiplied by 45% and 65% to determine the recommended range. In this case, 1650 kcal is the total energy intake and when multiplied by 45% and 65%, a range of 742.5 to 1072.5 kcal is calculated.
