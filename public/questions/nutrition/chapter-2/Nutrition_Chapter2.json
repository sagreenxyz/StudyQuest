      "question": "Which food sources supply carbohydrates in the form of naturally occurring sugars?",
      "options": [
        "Cakes and cookies",
        "Fruit and dairy products",
        "Whole grains and cereals",
        "Legumes and rice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fruit and dairy products are sources of naturally occurring sugars, including fructose and lactose. Cakes and cookies contain added sugars, not naturally occurring sugars. Whole grains and cereals, as well as legumes and rice, contain complex carbohydrates such as dietary fiber and are not sources of naturally occurring sugars."

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "Which statement about carbohydrate absorption is true?",
      "options": [
        "Chemical digestion of carbohydrates is completed in the large intestine.",
        "Stomach acid and enzymes increase amylase action for carbohydrate absorption.",
        "Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the large intestine.",
        "Carbohydrates must be broken down into monosaccharides before they can be absorbed into circulation."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Carbohydrates must be broken down into monosaccharides before they can be absorbed into circulation. Chemical digestion of carbohydrates is completed in the small intestine. Stomach acid and enzymes halt amylase action. Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth and progresses through the gastrointestinal tract."

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "What is the dietary reference intake (DRI) per day for carbohydrates for adults?",
      "options": [
        "75 to 125 g",
        "150 to 200 g",
        "225 to 325 g",
        "350 to 450 g"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The DRIs recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake come from carbohydrate foods; this translates to 225 to 325 g of carbohydrates for a 2000 kcal/day diet. Further, 75 to 125 g and 150 to 200 g are too low, and 350 to 450 g of carbohydrates is too high."

        "Carrots"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Polysaccharides, including starch and certain fibers, are complex carbohydrates. Beans are an example of a food containing complex carbohydrates. Milk and carrots contain disaccharides, which are classified as simple carbohydrates. Peaches and other fruits contain monosaccharides, which are also considered simple carbohydrates."

      "options": [
        "Complex carbohydrates may provide fiber in addition to glucose.",
        "Complex carbohydrates are not digestible by the body and pass through undigested.",
        "Complex carbohydrates include all carbohydrates composed of more than one sugar unit.",
        "Complex carbohydrates circulate freely in the blood and are the main source of energy for the brain."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Complex carbohydrates may provide fiber in addition to glucose. Although some complex carbohydrates, such as fiber, are not digestible, others are digested and broken down into glucose. Disaccharides are composed of two single-sugar units but are considered simple carbohydrates. Simple, not complex, carbohydrates circulate freely in the blood and are the main source of energy for the brain."

      "options": [
        "The only real nutrient function of carbohydrates is the supply of energy.",
        "Natural carbohydrate sweeteners are accompanied by essential nutrients.",
        "The sweeteners provided by carbohydrates help regulate blood glucose levels.",
        "Carbohydrates provide dietary fiber, which is crucial for effective bodily functions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Although carbohydrates provide energy, fiber, and sweeteners, the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates is the supply of energy. Carbohydrate sweeteners found naturally in some foods are accompanied by essential nutrients; however, this does not describe the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates. Sweeteners provided by carbohydrates do affect blood glucose levels; however, this statement does not clearly describe the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates. Dietary fiber is used by the body for several purposes; however, the provision of dietary fiber is not the real nutrient function of carbohydrates."

        "Oligosaccharide",
        "Monosaccharide"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Lactose is composed of glucose and galactose and is considered a disaccharide. Lactose is not considered an oligosaccharide or polysaccharide, because it only contains two sugar units. Lactose is not considered a monosaccharide, because it has more than one sugar unit."

      ],
      "correctAnswers": [0, 1, 3],
      "explanation": "The preferred energy source of the body cells is starch, because starch yields glucose; rice, pasta, and white bread, which are high in starch, are appropriate choices. Vegetables and fruits supply carbohydrates in the form of naturally occurring sugars, which are not preferred energy sources."

        "Hamburger buns and whole-wheat bread can be good sources of complex carbohydrates.",
        "Two easily obtained sources of complex carbohydrates are sugar beets and corn syrup."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Sugar beets and corn syrup are sources of simple carbohydrates, not complex carbohydrates. Corn, peas, and oatmeal are all good sources of complex carbohydrates. Potatoes are a good source of complex carbohydrates if the skin is eaten as well, because the skin contains a greater concentration of dietary fiber. Hamburger buns and whole-wheat bread are both good sources of complex carbohydrates."

      ],
      "correctAnswers": [0, 1, 4],
      "explanation": "Fruit drinks, sports drinks, and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are highly processed or contain added sugars that contribute to dental caries; thus these foods should be minimized or avoided in the diet. Whole fruits have naturally occurring sugars that pose less of a risk to the teeth. Whole-grain breads can help prevent dental caries, because unprocessed starch cannot pass through the dental plaque to attack the enamel."

        "Use fruit purees instead of sugar as sweeteners in cakes."
      ],
      "correctAnswers": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "explanation": "Reading food labels to avoid those with added sugars, using fruits canned in water or natural juice rather than syrup, using fresh fruit instead of syrup on pancakes and waffles, and using fruit purees as sweeteners instead of sugar in cakes can all help decrease the amount of added sugar in the diet. Replacing soft drinks with fruit drinks will not decrease added sugar in the diet because most fruit drinks contain added sugars."

        "Essential nutrients",
        "Protein"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The body can digest and metabolize carbohydrates to produce glucose for energy. Glucose is the basic single sugar in human metabolism and is the primary fuel source for cells. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein that are necessary for constructing and repairing body tissues. Essential nutrients are substances that a person must obtain from food because the body cannot make them in sufficient quantity to meet physiologic needs. The primary function of protein is tissue building, and amino acids are the building blocks of protein."

        "Flaxseed",
        "Bran cereal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Oranges are a source of pectin, which binds bile acid and thus reduces serum cholesterol levels. Popcorn and flaxseed are sources of cellulose and mucilage, respectively, and do not play a role in cholesterol reduction. Bran cereal will bind bile acid and help reduce serum cholesterol levels, but it is a source of hemicellulose, not pectin."

        "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)",
        "Crohn's disease",
        "Diverticulitis",
        "Lactose intolerance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Bloating, gas pain, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea following ingestion of lactose-containing foods (e.g., milk, cheese, or ice cream) suggest lactose intolerance. IBS may produce similar symptoms; however, there is no relationship between IBS symptoms and lactose-containing foods. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the lining of the digestive tract becomes inflamed, producing pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. Crohn's symptoms are not exclusive to ingestion of lactose-containing foods, nor are diverticulitis symptoms."
