      "explanation": "The diet history is a lengthy interview process conducted by a highly trained nutrition professional. The 24- hour food recall is a fast and inexpensive interview requiring the patient to recall their typical dietary intake over 24 hours. A multiple-day food record requires the patient to record types and amounts of foods and beverages consumed over 3 to 7 days. A food-frequency questionnaire, self-administered by the patient, indicates how many times per day, week, month, or year specific foods are consumed. pp. 303-304"

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The priority nutrition diagnosis in this situation is \"Swallowing difficulty related to stroke, as evidenced by coughing following drinking of thin liquids.\" This indicates that the airway could be compromised because the patient has signs of aspiration. The patient should have nothing by mouth, the health care provider should be notified, and further testing should be done, because aspiration may compromise respirations. Self-feeding difficulty is a problem for the patient but it is not the priority. Respiratory status is the priority. Depression often occurs in the recovery phase of stroke, as indicated by the patient’s statement; however, physical needs such as aspiration prevention precede psychosocial needs such as depression. The inability to manage self- care is not the priority when respiratory status is compromised."

      "explanation": "The diagnosis most appropriate for a patient at risk for hypertension is \"Excessive calorie intake related to regular consumption of large portions of high-fat meals, as evidenced by diet history and BMI of 35.\"As the RD performs the nutritional assessment and clusters the data, risk factors for hypertension include obesity, high-fat meals, and BMI of 35. Altered gastrointestinal function related to GERD does not indicate a risk for hypertension. Undesirable food choices caused by anorexia would result in problems such as dental caries, cardiac dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and thin body stature, not the development of hypertension. Increasing sources of energy (i.e., food) for a patient at risk for hypertension is contraindicated."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Alcohol intake with isoniazid can increase the possibility of hepatotoxicity and decrease the blood level of isoniazid, so asking the patient about alcohol intake would be important. The patient’s symptoms are unlikely to be caused by any disease contracted abroad. Coffee typically does not cause these symptoms, and a lack of INH itself would not cause nausea, jaundice, or dark-colored urine. pp. 310-311"

      "options": [
        "is incorrect?"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, so these patients will not need to have increased potassium in the diet, making this an incorrect statement. Famotidine decreases absorption of vitamin B 17, so supplements may be needed. Phenytoin increases the metabolism of folate, vitamin D, and vitamin K, so intake of these nutrients would need to be increased. Oral contraceptives that contain estrogen and progestin can cause selective malabsorption, or increased metabolism and turnover, which can affect vitamin B ¢ and folate, requiring an increase in intake of these nutrients. Test-Taking Tip: Answer the question that is asked. Read the situation and the question carefully, looking for key words or phrases. Do not read anything into the question or apply what you did in a similar situation during one of your clinical experiences. Think of each question as being an ideal, yet realistic, situation."

      "options": [
        "\"Peppermint is a great herb to use for gastrointestinal issues, and it would be helpful to continue"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Overuse of peppermint can lead to heartburn, so the nurse’s best response is to tell the patient that the primary health care provider may recommend they stop using it. The nurse should not recommend continued use because the peppermint may be causing the heartburn. Peppermint does decrease muscle spasms of the gastrointestinal tract but stating that it is odd that the patient is experiencing heartburn would not be valid because peppermint use can be associated with heartburn. The nurse should not recommend continued use of the peppermint in combination with other medications because the peppermint could be the cause of the current issues with heartburn."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Guided questioning during the patient history stage of nutrition assessment can help the patient remember and identify the use of complementary and alternative medicine. Clinical signs relevant to a patient’s nutrition status are identified during nutrition-focused physical findings. Anthropometric measurements are used in clinical practice to predict basic nutrition risk parameters and are not used to identify the use of complementary and alternative medicine. The patient’s basic eating habits are used to identify possible nutrition deficiencies when the food and nutrition-related history is obtained, but this does not include identifying the use of complementary and alternative medicine."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Nutrition monitoring and evaluation phase identifies the patients’ progress toward their goals and uses all of the categories used in nutrition assessment except patient history. The nutrition assessment phase uses five categories to collect, classify, and synthesize information about the patient’s nutrition status, including nutrition-related history, anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, medical tests and procedures, nutrition-focused physical findings, and patient history. The nutrition diagnosis phase uses the elements of problem, etiology, and signs/symptoms to determine the patient’s diagnosis. The nutrition intervention is the plan developed to resolve the nutrition-related etiology and/or diagnosis after the assessment and diagnosis have been completed."

      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Antacids can impair folate absorption, and folate deficiencies can cause neural tube defects and congenital anomalies of the heart, palate, and urinary tract. The effects may be offset by folate supplementation, so the nurse should instruct the patient to take folate supplements. Antacids may affect other vitamins and minerals as well, but iron, calcium, and magnesium are not linked to the risk for neural tube defects and congenital anomalies."

        "\"The doubly labeled water method is the most accurate measure of energy expenditure.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The gold standard for measuring energy expenditure is the doubly labeled water method. Participants ingest water labeled with a known concentration of isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. Elimination of the isotopes is measured to predict the energy expenditure and metabolic rate. Physical activity logs, physical activity questionnaires, and dietary intake logs are less accurate measures of energy expenditure."

      "explanation": "Anticlotting drugs inhibit the action of vitamin K. Too much vitamin K in the diet with anticlotting drugs will oppose the action of the drug while too little could cause serious hemorrhaging. Therefore the nurse needs to closely monitor the dietary intake of vitamin K for patients receiving anticlotting drugs. Vitamins C, D, and A do not interact with anticlotting drugs.

Ginseng is a hypoglycemic and should not alter the effects of propranolol. Psyllium is used for its laxative effect and can interfere with the absorption of some drugs but is not contraindicated with propranolol. Echinacea is used to prevent colds and flus and may lead to immunosuppression when taken for long periods, but it is does interact with propranolol."

Licorice is used for treatment of peptic ulcer or as an expectorant and would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for this use. Chamomile is recommended for indigestion, reduction of tension, and inducement of sleep, among other uses and would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for a hypoglycemic effect.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Asking the patient what an herb they are taking is \"supposed to do\" implies skepticism, which may embarrass the patient and result in dishonest reporting of supplement use. Asking the patient about dietary supplement use, whether or not the patient has experienced side effects, and whether or not they are seeing an herbalist or a naturopathic practitioner are therapeutic questions that do not imply skepticism or make the patient feel defensive. Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item.

If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice.

      "explanation": "Some antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) can bind to calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, thereby interfering with their absorption. Ciprofloxacin does not interfere with the absorption of potassium. Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple response question that requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem, read the situation and essential information carefully, and then formulate your response."

      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "Orlistat blocks fat from being absorbed from the intestines, so the diet should include no more than 30% of calories from fat to avoid an increase in side effects. Additionally, the drug should be taken during or within 1 hour of the meal. A multivitamin should be taken once a day at least 2 hours before or after the Orlistat to address potential deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins caused by the drug. Following a reduced-calorie diet may be helpful but is not indicated as a requirement for this particular drug used to treat obesity. Alcohol may increase the dizziness effects of benzphetamine but is not typically a side effect of Orlistat. Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses."

      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "The nurse may suggest drinking liquids between rather than with meals; consuming small, frequent meals and snacks that are dry, bland, and low in fiber; and trying ginger or vitamin B ¢ supplements to reduce nausea. Dry fruits, vegetables, and whole grains at mealtime are suggested to relieve constipation, not nausea. Eating whole grains three times per day increases gastrointestinal motility and may increase nausea. Increasing fluids with each meal is appropriate for relief of constipation but this may increase nausea."

      "explanation": "MG is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies at the neuromuscular junction that attack acetylcholine receptors. The attack prevents acetylcholine from stimulating muscle contractions and may result in dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing. The patient can progress from a weak voice to full respiratory arrest. Seizures are not common to MG. Dyskinesia and rigidity occur with Parkinson disease, not MG. Unilateral paralysis occurs with cerebral vascular accidents, not MG."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, so these patients will not need to have increased potassium in the diet, making this an incorrect statement. Famotidine decreases absorption of vitamin B 17, so supplements may be needed. Phenytoin increases the metabolism of folate, vitamin D, and vitamin K, so intake of these nutrients would need to be increased. Oral contraceptives that contain estrogen and progestin can cause selective malabsorption, or increased metabolism and turnover, which can affect vitamin B ¢ and folate, requiring an increase in intake of these nutrients. Test-Taking Tip: Answer the question that is asked. Read the situation and the question carefully, looking for key words or phrases. Do not read anything into the question or apply what you did in a similar situation during one of your clinical experiences. Think of each question as being an ideal, yet realistic, situation."

Clinical signs relevant to a patient’s nutrition status are identified during nutrition-focused physical findings. Anthropometric measurements are used in clinical practice to predict basic nutrition risk parameters and are not used to identify the use of complementary and alternative medicine. The patient’s basic eating habits are used to identify possible nutrition deficiencies when the food and nutrition-related history is obtained, but this does not include identifying the use of complementary and alternative medicine."

      "explanation": "Nutrition monitoring and evaluation phase identifies the patients’ progress toward their goals and uses all of the categories used in nutrition assessment except patient history. The nutrition assessment phase uses five categories to collect, classify, and synthesize information about the patient’s nutrition status, including nutrition-related history, anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, medical tests and procedures, nutrition-focused physical findings, and patient history. The nutrition diagnosis phase uses the elements of problem, etiology, and signs/symptoms to determine the patient’s diagnosis. The nutrition intervention is the plan developed to resolve the nutrition-related etiology and/or diagnosis after the assessment and diagnosis have been completed."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The gold standard for measuring energy expenditure is the doubly labeled water method. Participants ingest water labeled with a known concentration of isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. Elimination of the isotopes is measured to predict the energy expenditure and metabolic rate. Physical activity logs, physical activity questionnaires, and dietary intake logs are less accurate measures of energy expenditure."

      "explanation": "Garlic should not be consumed with propranolol because of its potential to inhibit liver metabolism, which can impact the effects of the propranolol. Ginseng is a hypoglycemic and should not alter the effects of propranolol. Psyllium is used for its laxative effect and can interfere with the absorption of some drugs but is not contraindicated with propranolol. Echinacea is used to prevent colds and flus and may lead to immunosuppression when taken for long periods, but it is does interact with propranolol."

      "explanation": "Ginseng is often used for its hypoglycemic effect. Licorice is used for treatment of peptic ulcer or as an expectorant and would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for this use. Chamomile is recommended for indigestion, reduction of tension, and inducement of sleep, among other uses and would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for a hypoglycemic effect.

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Asking the patient what an herb they are taking is \"supposed to do\" implies skepticism, which may embarrass the patient and result in dishonest reporting of supplement use. Asking the patient about dietary supplement use, whether or not the patient has experienced side effects, and whether or not they are seeing an herbalist or a naturopathic practitioner are therapeutic questions that do not imply skepticism or make the patient feel defensive. Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real intent of the question."
