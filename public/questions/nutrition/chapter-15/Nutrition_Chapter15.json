      "explanation": "As used in the traditional medical sense, obese is the clinical term for a patient who has excess body fat and is generally used to describe people who are at least 20% above the recommended weight for height. The term normal weight denotes a body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m *. The terms overweight and obesity are often used interchangeably, but they technically have different meanings. Overweight denotes a body weight that is above a population weight-for-height standard without regard to body composition. Clinically obese indicates a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m 2."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient experiences recurrent episodes of eating after the evening meal or upon waking. The syndrome is not caused by an abnormal sleep-wake cycle; it interferes with a normal sleep-wake cycle. The patient is aware and can recall food consumption that occurs throughout the night. A patient with binge eating disorder expresses guilt for consuming large quantities of food, but this is not necessarily true of a patient with night eating syndrome."

      "explanation": "Energy- and nutrient-dense diets that are above the standard requirements are considered for underweight and undernourished patients. High-protein and high-carbohydrates diets are considered for underweight patients to rebuild tissues and provide the primary energy source in an easily digested form. Moderate fat, not high intake of fat, is included in special nutrition care for underweight patients to provide essential fatty acids and add energy without exceeding tolerance limits."

        "Having the ability to be flexible with an eating schedule"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Normal eating, as opposed to disordered eating, involves having the ability to be flexible with an eating schedule. Normal eating involves eating when hungry and stopping when full. It does not involve eating a fixed quantity of food daily even if not hungry. Normal eating also involves demonstrating moderate restraint with regard to food selection and recognizing that overeating and undereating are sometimes acceptable and trusting the body to establish a balance. Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be wrong and lose precious points."

      "explanation": "Until recently, health practitioners overlooked a patient’s age as an important factor for setting an ideal body weight. A patient’s weight will usually increase with age, then decline after a certain age. Genetics is one of several factors considered when determining a reasonable body weight for a patient. Body mass index (BMI) has been used for decades to help clinicians determine reasonable body weights for patients. Waist circumference helps improve accuracy when assessing a patient’s chronic disease and mortality risk.

In 2012, the FDA approved the drug lorcaserin primarily for use in obese and/or patients with type 2 diabetes; it is still in use. Sibutramine was a weight-loss drug that was removed from the market by the FDA in 2010 because of an increased risk for heart attack and stroke.

      "explanation": "In a patient with an eating disorder, the nurse expects adherence to a rigid eating schedule. Normal eating occurs when an individual has the ability to be flexible with an eating schedule. Eating when hungry, recognizing overeating is sometimes acceptable, and demonstrating moderate restraint of food choices are all defined as normal eating behaviors. Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items.

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The most important factor affecting weight loss is the establishment of a negative energy balance with a reduction of about 500 kcal/day. Realistic goals for weight loss determine overall weight loss and rate of loss but do not address the need for reduction of 500 kcal/day. Cultural appeal ensures that an individual can maintain cultural eating patterns while losing weight, but it does not address the need for reduction of 500 kcal/day. For weight loss to be successful, it must be nutritionally adequate. Patients must consume less food and consciously choose nutrient-dense foods. However, this does not specifically address the need for a reduction of 500 kcal/day. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think that they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

      "explanation": "The patient who performs an average of 15 minutes of physical activity daily is most at risk for obesity. A major contributor to obesity in Americans is physical inactivity. Walking more than 30 minutes per day can help reduce total body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and resting heart rate. This increase in physical activity can also improve glucose tolerance, independent of changes to dietary intake. Obesity is associated with leptin resistance, but the exact role leptin plays in human obesity remains unclear. Ghrelin increases appetite and adiposity, so ghrelin resistance would not put someone at risk for obesity. A patient whose energy output exceeds intake by 100 kcal daily would likely lose weight.

      "explanation": "Based on the patient’s statement, the nurse would suspect binge eating disorder. Binge eating disorder is a psychiatric eating disorder characterized by the occurrence of eating excessive amounts of food at least twice a week for a 6-month period. Anorexia nervosa results in malnourishment and starvation due to an aversion to food or a distorted body image. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder related to a person’s fear of fatness in which cycles of gorging on large quantities of food are followed by compensatory mechanisms to maintain a normal body weight. Body dysmorphic disorder is a result of an obsession with a perceived defect of the body."

      "explanation": "The patient who performs an average of 15 minutes of physical activity daily is most at risk for obesity. A major contributor to obesity in Americans is physical inactivity. Walking more than 30 minutes per day can help reduce total body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and resting heart rate. This increase in physical activity can also improve glucose tolerance, independent of changes to dietary intake. Obesity is associated with leptin resistance, but the exact role leptin plays in human obesity remains unclear. Ghrelin increases appetite and adiposity, so ghrelin resistance would not put someone at risk for obesity. A patient whose energy output exceeds intake by 100 kcal daily would likely lose weight.

      "explanation": "Weight-loss fad diets fail because they are often nutritionally inadequate and based on false claims, setting individuals up for failure. The degree of energy restriction required by some fad diets is impossible to maintain long term. Books and supplements sell briefly and then fade away because the quick fixes either do not work or are not sustainable; individuals who try these fads are led to believe that weight loss is easy and effortless. People are often set up for failure regarding the maintenance of healthy weight because they fail to address the necessity of changing long-term habits and behaviors. Fast and convenient foods may cost less than energy-dense foods, but this is not a cause of fad diet failure. Rather, it is an environmental factor that adds to the ever-increasing problem of obesity."

Some individuals are allergic to specific foods and should avoid them, but the claim of harmful foods suggests that certain foods cause harm if eaten regardless of allergies. Claims about food combinations suggest that certain combinations of foods can restore health and are effective for weight loss; however, it does not consider all processed foods unhealthy."

Psychologic factors that cause a patient to refuse to eat or socioeconomic factors like limited access to food can also lead to malnutrition and weight loss. Gastrointestinal problems like chronic diarrhea, gastrointestinal disease, excessive use of laxatives, or drug-nutrient interactions can cause malabsorption and a patient becoming underweight. Hormone imbalances like hyperthyroidism increase the body’s caloric needs; if these needs are not met, malnutrition can result, and a patient can become underweight. Inadequate energy intake relative to energy needs occurs from greatly increased physical activity without a corresponding increase in food, or the lack of available food supply. Patients who live in a home with inadequate and infrequent meals can become underweight and malnourished."

This can involve using a food diary to document when, why, where, and how much food is consumed. Keeping track can help patients become aware of poor eating habits. The pursuit of emotional, social, and psychologic health helps patients focus on the goals developed for the weight- management program. An important component is stress management. Physical activity to increase the patient’s energy output must be addressed. The patient must be aware of changes that need to be made to their activity level for successful weight loss to be supported.

Decreasing simple carbohydrate intake will also help avoid complications and should be included in postsurgery counseling by the RDH."

      "explanation": "In 2012, the FDA approved the drug lorcaserin primarily for use in obese and/or patients with type 2 diabetes. Phentermine/topiramate was approved by the FDA in 2012 for use by patients who are obese and/or have type 2 diabetes. Sibutramine was a weight loss drug used for a short time before it was removed from the market by the FDA in 2010. Phenylpropanolamine was once a popular stimulant used for weight loss but is currently banned in the US. The popular weight loss drugs fenfluramine and phentermine were withdrawn from the market by the FDA after patients who were using them developed valvular regurgitation, which can be fatal."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Advertisements of \"ideal\" body types are an example of a psychological risk factor for obesity because they cultivate emotional stress in society. Pregnancy is a physiologic risk factor for obesity. Fast-food restaurants are environmental risk factors for obesity. Inappropriate family food patterns are a family reinforcement risk factor for obesity."

      "explanation": "In a patient with an eating disorder, the nurse expects adherence to a rigid eating schedule. Normal eating occurs when an individual has the ability to be flexible with an eating schedule. Eating when hungry, recognizing overeating is sometimes acceptable, and demonstrating moderate restraint of food choices are all defined as normal eating behaviors. Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "BIA is an easy, portable, inexpensive, and noninvasive body composition measurement tool. This method does not require any special skill on the technician’s part. Skin fold calipers need technical expertise because the method depends on the accuracy of locating the correct anatomical site. Air displacement plethysmography needs a BOD POD machine, which is expensive and not portable. Hydrostatic weighing is not portable or inexpensive."
