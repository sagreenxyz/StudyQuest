        "Hypertension",
        "Myocardial ischemia",
        "Myocardial infarction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Congestive heart failure is a condition in which a progressively weakened heart muscle, the myocardium, is unable to maintain adequate cardiac output to sustain normal blood circulation. Hypertension is a risk factor for congestive heart failure. Myocardial ischemia is the most common cause of congestive heart failure. Myocardial infarction is a heart attack."

      "question": "a Increased levels of which type of lipoprotein are a risk factor for atherosclerosis and why?",
      "options": [
        "Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are a risk factor because they carry cholesterol to tissues.",
        "High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a risk factor because they carry cholesterol to the liver.",
        "Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are a risk factor because they are formed from endogenous fat.",
        "Intermediate-density lipoproteins are a risk factor because they remain in the circulation after"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Increased levels of LDLs are a risk factor for atherosclerosis because they carry cholesterol to tissues, where it may be deposited in the form of plaque. HDLs are considered beneficial because they carry cholesterol to the liver for catabolism. High levels of all non-high-density lipoproteins are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, but not as a result of being formed from endogenous fat or remaining in circulation after degradation of VLDLs. Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer."

      "explanation": "Medical nutrition therapy goals for patients after MI are to promote recovery and strength and provide support in lowering LDL cholesterol levels and other known risk factors to prevent additional cardiovascular events. The Mediterranean and DASH diets are appropriate long-term eating plans for patients with cardiovascular disease who have suffered an MI. Immediately after an MI, the health care team may treat the patient with the MONA protocol, which is drug therapy. Fluid is limited to 2 L per day for individuals with serum sodium levels of less than 130 mEq/L. pp. 352-353"

      "options": [
        "Chylomicrons"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "HDLs transport cholesterol from the tissue and arteries back to the liver for catabolism. Chylomicrons transport absorbed dietary fat to plasma and tissues, primarily the liver. LDLs are formed endogenously by the liver and deliver cholesterol to tissues. IDLs deliver triglycerides, not cholesterol, to cells and tissues throughout the body. Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem, read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response."

        "Resistant hypertension"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Secondary hypertension is elevated blood pressure for which the cause can be identified and is a symptom or side effect of another primary condition. Primary or essential hypertension is an inherent form of high blood pressure with no specific identifiable cause; it is considered to be familial. Resistant hypertension is the presence of high blood pressure despite treatment with three antihypertensive medications. Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer."

        "By triggering the vasopressin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems to increase blood pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "In the patient with congestive heart failure, kidney nephrons sense decreased renal blood flow, which is normally an indication of dehydration and hypovolemia, and they respond by triggering the vasopressin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems to increase blood pressure. Consequently, fluid retention is increased, and edema is exacerbated. The GFR is decreased in kidney disease. Protein is allowed to pass through the glomerulus into the tubule as a result of nephrosis. The kidneys convert inactive vitamin D into active vitamin D, but this process is not upregulated in the patient with congestive heart failure."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Fluid is limited to 2 L per day for patients with serum sodium levels of less than 130 mEq/L in order to avoid exacerbating edema. Daily intake of 1 L is too little; 3 or 4 L daily is too much. Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Coronary heart disease is associated with elevated serum cholesterol levels, low levels of HDLs, and high levels of LDLs. Diabetes mellitus results in an abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates. Cirrhosis develops when scar tissue replaces normal liver tissue and is often associated with alcohol abuse. Chronic kidney disease is a gradual loss of renal function. Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer."

        "\"Choose 3 to 5 servings of fresh vegetables per day.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The student nurse requires correction when advising the patient to choose white bread over whole grains. The patient should choose whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and low-fat or fat-free milk. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Patients taking statin drugs, such as atorvastatin, should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice because these may affect the rate at which the medication is absorbed by the liver, causing side effects ranging from mild muscle pain to severe kidney failure. Atorvastatin can be taken with or without food. Apples and strawberries do not interfere with this drug."

        "Chyme",
        "Cholesterol"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Because fat is not soluble in water, it is carried in the bloodstream in small packages wrapped with protein called lipoproteins. Chyme is the semifluid food mass in the gastrointestinal tract that is present after gastric digestion. Cholesterol is a fat-related compound called a sterol. Triglycerides are fats in the body or in food composed of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol base. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The principles of medical nutrition therapy for CHF include achieving adequate nutrition, limiting sodium intake, and controlling edema. Limiting potassium may result in hypokalemia if the patient is treated with a loop diuretic. A positive fluid balance means there is more fluid being taken in than being excreted, which is a problem with CHF. Increasing fluid intake will further exacerbate CHF, a condition with fluid volume excess."

        "Decreased fluid retention",
        "Excretion of large amounts of dilute urine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "With decreased heart function, blood accumulates in the vascular system. This buildup offsets the delicate balance of filtration pressures and causes fluid to collect within intracellular spaces instead of flowing into fluid compartments. Fluid retention increases as a result of hormonal alterations. Excretion of large amounts of dilute urine occurs during the early stages of kidney failure. Reduction in GFR occurs in kidney disease.

      "explanation": "If blood flow to the heart is completely occluded, myocardial infarction may occur. A thrombus is a blood clot that can cause the occlusion of blood flow. Angina pectoris may occur if blood flow is partially occluded. A cerebrovascular accident may occur if blood flow is occluded in a cerebral artery.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The patient should be encouraged to use a salt alternative. Salt alternatives that may pair well with chicken soup include thyme, savory, ginger, white pepper, cloves, and allspice. The patient should not be encouraged to eat any amount of salt. Italian seasonings, such as nutmeg, oregano, basil, red pepper, and tarragon, are better suited for pasta, beans, or rice dishes. Eating soup without seasoning may not help the patient comply with the diet. Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important. Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong response. No real absolutes exist in life; however, every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care."

      "explanation": "The nurse knows the teaching was successful when the patient states, \"| will eat more fruits and vegetables and replace saturated fats with olive oil.\" Adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduces risk factors for cardiovascular disease, reduces levels of inflammatory markers following myocardial infarction, and increases the life span. Low-fat milk should be consumed rather than whole milk. Eating pork four times per week is excessive, though limiting butter intake is healthy. Increasing carbohydrates may cause a rise in low-density lipoproteins."

      "explanation": "Common blood pressure measurements indicate the pressure of the blood surge in the arteries of the upper arm with each heartbeat. A blood pressure of 134/83 mm Hg would be categorized as stage 1 hypertension. Stage 1 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg.

      "explanation": "The 55-year-old postmenopausal African American woman has the highest risk for atherosclerosis. Her age and race put her at a higher risk than the others. Although men have a greater risk of developing atherosclerosis than do women, the relative risks are similar for both sexes after women reach menopause. High levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol are protective against atherosclerosis. Poor diet quality, high levels of inflammatory markers, high BMI, and cigarette smoking are modifiable risk factors that could impact risk, particularly for men and women in their 30s and early 40s."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "There is a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease. The patient’s father (a first-degree relative) died of a coronary event, increasing the patient’s risk for a heart attack. A total cholesterol level of less than 200 mg/dL is considered optimal. A BMI of 19.0 kg/m 2 is normal. The fact that the patient’s mother has diabetes and high blood pressure increases the patient’s risk for those illnesses, but they are of a less- immediate concern in this scenario.

      "explanation": "The DASH diet has been shown to lower blood pressure significantly in a 2-week period by diet alone. A patient who consumes four servings of low-fat dairy per day is exceeding the recommendation of the DASH diet and would require additional teaching by the nurse. The recommendation for low-fat dairy intake is two to three servings per day. The patient indicating that nuts and grains are consumed regularly is following the guidelines of this diet. The DASH diet recommends eating four to six servings of fruits and four to six servings of vegetables per day. Lean meats are recommended for consumption as part of the diet. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question. pp. 360-361"

Pain medication may be beneficial, but pain may be reduced by spreading small meals out over the course of the day, and nonpharmacologic measures should be tried first. Contacting the health care provider would be appropriate, but the nurse can first attempt to reduce the workload on the heart by spreading the patient’s feedings out over the course of the day.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The prevalence of premature cardiovascular mortality is significantly higher in certain high-risk populations, such as Native Americans and South Asian Americans, individuals with low education levels, those with few socioeconomic resources, and overweight/obese individuals. The Native American patient who is obese, smokes, and has a high school diploma would be at greatest risk for premature cardiovascular mortality. The Asian-American patient who is inactive would be at a risk, but having a college degree helps lower that risk. The Hispanic patient who is 100% below the poverty level would be at risk but is obtaining a higher level of education, which helps lower the risk. The African-American patient who is overweight would be at risk but has a college degree and works as an accountant, both of which lower the risk. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think that they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response. pp. 363-364"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Diuretics are one of the first-line medications used to lower blood pressure. The continuous use of diuretics may cause a loss of potassium. The nurse would recommend eating green, leafy vegetables to help maintain a normal serum potassium level. Nuts would also be recommended for consumption because they are also high in potassium. Orange juice is another food that contains potassium and should be recommended to the patient. Informing the patient to drink more fluids would counteract the reason for using a diuretic. Because this patient has a history of heart failure, they may have fluid restrictions."

      "explanation": "Regardless of hypertensive stage, all patients should receive patient-centered, culturally sensitive guidance on achieving applicable behavioral and lifestyle modifications. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines suggest limiting alcohol intake because moderate alcohol intake is associated with a reduction of systolic blood pressure by 4 mm Hg. Chronic stress takes a toll on the body and may lead to elevated blood pressure. Excess weight is closely associated with hypertensive risk factors; the ACC/AHA guidelines note that weight loss is the most important intervention for treating hypertension. There is an inverse relationship between potassium intake and blood pressure; a high-potassium intake lowers blood pressure. The recommended sodium intake for blood pressure control is 1500 to 2300 mg per day. Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the question that was asked? If the question stem asks \"why,\" be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural responses.

Medical nutrition therapy goals for patients after MI include promoting recovery and strength and providing support in lowering LDL cholesterol and other known risk factors to prevent additional cardiovascular disease events. Medical nutrition therapy also involves reducing metabolic workload on the damaged heart by spreading small meals out over the course of the day. Early feedings may include foods that are relatively soft in texture or easily digested to avoid excess effort during eating. To lose weight and achieve a healthy BMI, the patient should increase exercise, so the effort exceeds the number of calories consumed each day.

Elevated blood pressure, also known as prehypertension, is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 129 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg. Normal blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg. Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such \"helpful hints.\""

      "question": "Which description of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet eating plan would the nurse provide to a patient who was recently diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension? Cy) © Eat lean meats, beans, and nuts.",
      "options": [
        "Eat low-fiber grains and low-sodium foods.",
        "Eat four servings of low-fat dairy foods per day.",
        "Eat three servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables per day."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The DASH diet is the result of the DASH landmark study, in which blood pressure was significantly lowered by diet alone over 2 weeks. The DASH diet recommends eating lean meats, beans, and nuts. The diet recommends eating high-fiber, not low-fiber, foods and low-sodium foods. It also recommends eating two to three servings of low-fat dairy foods per day, not four servings. Further, the diet recommends eating four to six servings of fruits and four to six servings of vegetables per day, not three servings. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten. pp. 360-361"

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 55-year-old postmenopausal African American woman has the highest risk for atherosclerosis. Her age and race put her at a higher risk than the others. Although men have a greater risk of developing atherosclerosis than do women, the relative risks are similar for both sexes after women reach menopause. High levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol are protective against atherosclerosis. Poor diet quality, high levels of inflammatory markers, high BMI, and cigarette smoking are modifiable risk factors that could impact risk, particularly for men and women in their 30s and early 40s."

      "question": "The nurse is reviewing the medical record of a patient admitted to the hospital with cardiovascular disease. Which statement made by the patient is the nurse’s highest priority for addressing?",
      "options": [
        "\"My cholesterol level last week was 199 mg/dL.\"",
        "\"My body mass index (BMI) is 19.0 kg/m a",
        "@ \"My father died of a heart attack.\"",
        "\"My mother has diabetes and high blood pressure.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "There is a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease. The patient’s father (a first-degree relative) died of a coronary event, increasing the patient’s risk for a heart attack. A total cholesterol level of less than 200 mg/dL is considered optimal. A BMI of 19.0 kg/m 2 is normal. The fact that the patient’s mother has diabetes and high blood pressure increases the patient’s risk for those illnesses, but they are of a less- immediate concern in this scenario. Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are incorrect."

      "explanation": "The focus of a patient with myocardial infarction is to reduce the workload of the heart. As such, the patient is placed on liquids and may progress food consistency as tolerated. A low-sodium diet is recommended for patients with hypertension. Low-fat, high-protein diets are optimal for patients recovering from surgery or those with depleted energy stores. Supplementing meals with Ensure is usually recommended for patients with poor oral intake."
