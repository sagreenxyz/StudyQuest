      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Pinocytosis is the engulfing of a large molecule by the cell; materials attach to the cell membrane before the cell engulfs it. Active transport assists particles to move against their concentration gradient with the help of a carrier molecule; it does not involve engulfing large molecules. Simple diffusion is the force by which molecules move from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration, not engulfing molecules. Facilitated diffusion is a carrier-assisted movement of larger items across the mucosal cell membrane; it does not involve engulfing large molecules."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Despite rigorous treatment of adhering to a strict galactose-free diet, patients with galactosemia generally experience complications, such as cognitive disability, speech problems, neurologic and/or movement disorders, and ovarian dysfunction, at some point in life. Celiac disease is an allergy to the protein gluten and is not a genetic disorder. Phenylketonuria can cause severe irreversible brain damage and central nervous system damage if left untreated but can be controlled by a low-phenylalanine diet consisting of a special supplemental nutrition formula. Glycogen-storage diseases are controlled by dietary treatment to avoid hypoglycemia."

      "explanation": "The Krebs cycle is the hub of energy production that occurs in the mitochondria of the cell. The mitochondria convert energy into a form the body can use. The combined processes of metabolism, catabolism, and anabolism occur in the Krebs cycle to ensure that the body has much needed energy in the form of ATP. ATP is not produced at a consistent rate; its production fluctuates depending on the energy needs at a given time. The Krebs cycle is not the sum of chemical reactions that occur within a cell; this is the definition of metabolism."

      "explanation": "The process of simplifying whole food into molecules small enough for absorption requires vitamins and minerals to be liberated. When digestion is complete, carbohydrates are reduced to monosaccharides. The process of digestion frees individual acids from complex proteins, and fatty acids and monoglycerides are freed from triglycerides. With a water base for solution and transport, in addition to the necessary electrolytes, the whole fluid food-derived mass is primed for absorption. pp. 62-63"

      "explanation": "Water and electrolytes assist in carrying the products of digestion through the gastrointestinal tract into the tissues. Bile emulsifies fat into smaller pieces to expose more surface area for the actions of fat-splitting enzymes. Mucus lubricates and protects the mucosal tissues that line the gastrointestinal tract and help moisten the food mass. Digestive enzymes are responsible for breaking down nutrients. Hydrochloric acid and buffer ions are needed to produce the correct pH (i.e., the degree of acidity or alkalinity) that is necessary for enzymatic activity."

      "explanation": "Gastroesophageal reflux is commonly called heartburn. When the gastroesophageal sphincter is working properly, it prevents acid-mixed food from seeping from the stomach back into the esophagus. One cause of gastroesophageal reflux is a hiatal hernia, which occurs when part of the stomach protrudes upward into the chest cavity. Heartburn has nothing to do with the heart, but it was so named because the sensations are perceived as originating in the region of the heart."

        "Metabolism of glucose yields more nitrogen waste compared with glucose."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The metabolism of glucose yields less energy than the metabolism of fat because carbohydrates have 4 kcal/g and fat has 9 kcal/g. Fat does not have fewer kilocalories per gram compared with carbohydrates. The use of protein as a source of energy is inefficient and yields extra nitrogen waste. Metabolism of fat and glucose does not yield extra nitrogen waste."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The salivary glands secrete a mucous material that lubricates and binds food particles to facilitate the swallowing of each food bolus. Lingual lipase is secreted by small glands at the back of the tongue, and during infancy this enzyme helps with the digestion of milk fat. Gastrin is a hormone found in gastric secretions that helps with chemical digestion in the stomach. Salivary amylase, secreted by the salivary glands, is a starch-splitting enzyme."

      "question": "Which result is the consequence of decreased hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach? Select all that apply.",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "Because hydrochloric acid kills microorganisms in the stomach, decreased secretion will increase the bacterial load. Decreased secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach will reduce the activation of pepsinogen. The digestive process of protein may be altered if the secretion of hydrochloric acid is decreased, because hydrochloric acid begins the digestive process of protein. Situations that decrease hydrochloric acid in the stomach will reduce the bioavailability of vitamin B 12, calcium, iron, and magnesium further along in the digestive process. Stomach content is normally very acidic because the release of hydrochloric acid lowers the pH."

      "explanation": "Muscle tone in the gastrointestinal wall is controlled by the intramural nerve plexus. The intramural nerve plexus is responsible for coordinating all movements within the gastrointestinal wall. The rate and intensity of muscle contractions is regulated by the intramural nerve plexus. The layers of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal wall are responsible for peristalsis, forcing contents forward in the gastrointestinal tract. Tonic contraction is a type of movement provided by the smooth muscle."

      "explanation": "The form in which the nutrient is present is one factor that determines a nutrient’s bioavailability. One of the factors that determines a nutrient’s bioavailability is the competition among nutrients for common absorptive sites. The amount of nutrient present in the gastrointestinal tract is a factor that determines a nutrient’s bioavailability. The whole fluid, food-derived mass is ready for absorption before the nutrient’s bioavailability is determined. The point of absorption becomes the vital gatekeeper that determines how much of a nutrient is available for cellular use; it does not determine the actual bioavailability of the nutrient. pp. 63, 65"

Bile, hydrochloric acid, and electrolytes do not lubricate mucosal tissues or help to moisten the food mass. Bile emulsifies fat into smaller pieces to expose more surface area for the actions of fat-splitting enzymes. Hydrochloric acid and buffer ions produce the correct pH needed for enzymatic activity. Water and electrolytes help carry the products of digestion through the Gl tract into the tissues. Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered.

Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone secreted from the mucosal epithelium of the small intestine in response to the presence of fat and certain amino acids in chyme. CCK inhibits gastric motility, increases the release of pancreatic enzymes, and stimulates the gallbladder to secrete bile into the small intestine. Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is a hormone secreted from the enterocytes of the duodenum and jejunum in response to the presence of glucose and fat. GIP stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas and inhibits gastric motility. The hormone gastrin stimulates parietal cells within the lining of the stomach to secrete hydrochloric acid."

Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice.

When the gastroesophageal sphincter is not working properly, it may allow acid-mixed food to seep back into the esophagus from the stomach, resulting in reflux or heartburn. \"Part of the stomach is pushing down into the chest cavity\" is an inaccurate description of a hiatal hernia that can cause heartburn. The stomach is protruding upward into the chest cavity, not downward. \"The sphincter of the stomach is not allowing the food to move through\" is inaccurate because acid would not be moving up into the esophagus since nothing could pass through. \"Eating while reclined is interfering with the food staying in the stomach\" does happens in hiatal hernia or reflux, but it is not the underlying cause of heartburn.

      "explanation": "Fatty materials have to pass through the lymph before being absorbed in the thoracic duct because they are not water soluble. The fatty materials do not require active transport; they are not too large, and they are broken down before being absorbed into the lymph. Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the question that was asked? If the question stem asks \"why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal the correct answer."

      "explanation": "Most of the water that enters the large intestine is absorbed in the first half of the colon. Water is not absorbed in the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum. The stomach is an absorption site for material such as alcohol. The absorption of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc occur in the duodenum. The jejunum is the site for absorption of water-soluble vitamins."

      "explanation": "Three important structures of the intestinal wall surface are particularly adapted to ensure the maximal absorption of essential nutrients in the digestive process. Mucosal folds are the large, visible folds of the mucous lining of the small intestine that increase the absorbing surface area. Villi are finger-like projections that cover the mucosal surfaces of the small intestine, which further increases the absorbing surface area. Microvilli are extremely small, hair-like projections that cover all of the villi on the surface of the small intestine, greatly increasing the total absorbing surface area. The fundus and hepatocytes are not anatomic structures of the of the intestinal wall surface. Fundus is the upper portion of the stomach. Hepatocytes are functional cells of the liver. pp. 65-66"

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and in an area as complex as nursing, an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices."

      "options": [],
      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "The gastric secretions contain three types of materials that help with chemical digestion in the stomach: acid, mucus, and gastric enzymes. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach creates the necessary degree of acidity for gastric enzymes to work, activates the first protease (pepsinogen), and aids in the absorption of several vitamins and minerals. Pepsin is a gastric enzyme that aids in splitting proteins. Mucus protects the stomach lining from the erosive effect of hydrochloric acid. Mucus also helps bind, mix, and move the food mass along the GI tract. Pancreatic enzymes and bile aid in chemical digestion in the small intestine."

The myenteric plexus is situated between the circular muscle layer and the longitudinal muscle layer in the lower esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The submucous plexus is located in the submucosal tissue in the intestinal walls. The cervical plexus serves the neck, shoulders, and head."

Digestion is the process by which food is broken down in the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract. Absorption is the process by which nutrients are taken into the cells that line the Gl tract. Metabolism is the sum of the vast number of chemical changes in the cell that ultimately produce the materials that are essential for energy, tissue building, and metabolic controls."

Muscle tone or tonic contraction is provided by the smooth muscle, which ensures continuous passage of the food mass and valve control along the way. Swallowing is facilitated by muscles at the base of the tongue. Constriction is not a type of movement provided by the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal wall. Stimulation is provided by secretions in various parts of the digestive system; it is not a smooth muscle movement."

      "explanation": "The lymphatic system provides an alternative route for fat-soluble nutrient absorption because fats are not water soluble. Water-soluble nutrients are absorbed into the vascular system (i.e., the blood circulatory system) directly from the intestinal cells. The nutrients travel first to the liver for immediate use by the hepatocytes through portal circulation. After traveling to the liver, the circulatory system disperses remaining nutrients to other cells throughout the body. The lymphatic system provides an alternative route for fat-soluble, not water- soluble, nutrients."

      "explanation": "The bolus is propelled forward from the esophagus through the gastroesophageal sphincter into the stomach; by the time it reaches the lower portion of the stomach (the antrum), it is a semiliquid acid-food mix called chyme. The food enters the fundus, the upper part of the stomach, as individual bolus lumps. When the food mass is released into the duodenum by the pyloric valve, it has already been converted to chyme. Salivary amylase mixes with food while it is in the mouth so that it can be swallowed in the form of a bolus; this is not part of mechanical digestion in the stomach."

The chemical digestion of protein begins when the pancreatic enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin split large protein molecules into smaller peptide fragments and then into single amino acids. The chemical digestion of fat occurs when pancreatic lipase converts triglycerides into monoglycerides and fatty acids. Enterokinase is an intestinal enzyme that activates trypsinogen, which converts to trypsin. Cholecystokinin is a hormone, not an enzyme. pp. 61-62"

Active transport assists particles to move against their concentration gradient with the help of a carrier molecule; it does not involve engulfing large molecules. Simple diffusion is the force by which molecules move from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration, not engulfing molecules. Facilitated diffusion is a carrier-assisted movement of larger items across the mucosal cell membrane; it does not involve engulfing large molecules."

Celiac disease is an allergy to the protein gluten and is not a genetic disorder. Phenylketonuria can cause severe irreversible brain damage and central nervous system damage if left untreated but can be controlled by a low-phenylalanine diet consisting of a special supplemental nutrition formula. Glycogen-storage diseases are controlled by dietary treatment to avoid hypoglycemia."
