      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting in the destruction of beta cells. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors are involved. One or more autoantibodies are present in the majority of individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is an insidious disease; it is not uncommon for a person to have type 2 diabetes years before diagnosis. Occasionally, the stress of pregnancy may induce gestational diabetes. This is a form of glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy only. Prediabetes occurs before type 2 diabetes. Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices. pp. 366-367"

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Because patients with type 1 diabetes cannot make enough insulin on their own, they will always need to take insulin. Even if they count carbohydrates as part of their nutrition plan, they will still need to take insulin. The insulin is needed throughout the day, not just once per day. Blood glucose can be managed with diet and exercise for some patients with type 2 diabetes but not for patients with type 1 diabetes because they cannot make their own insulin. Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Exercise is important for a patient with type 2 diabetes who is already maintaining a healthy weight because it improves cellular uptake of glucose. Exercise does not potentiate the activation of insulin or decrease the effects of glucose. Exercise requires energy, which is supplied by glucose; therefore exercise lowers the glucose level, not the effect of glucose. A patient who is not overweight does not need a negative energy balance."

      ],
      "explanation": "Blood glucose needs to be monitored to prevent hypoglycemia. Food distribution needs to be planned ahead when using insulin and should be adjusted according to the day’s scheduled activities. A stressful event caused by any source causes an adrenaline rush, a fight-or-flight effect that counteracts insulin activity and can contribute to a glycemic response. A nutrition plan should be adjusted daily based on schedules and stressful periods. When developing a nutrition plan for children and adolescents, consideration needs to be given to their activity level, growth spurts, and changing hormone patterns; this is not true for adults."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "When insulin is at its peak, a patient’s blood glucose is at its lowest. Because exercise can also lower blood glucose, patients should avoid exercise when insulin is at its peak in order to prevent hypoglycemia. Patients with type 1 diabetes are encouraged to exercise but should avoid exercise when their fasting blood glucose level is greater than 300 mg/dL. As long as the patient does not have complications and their blood glucose is under control, the patient can perform all levels of exercise."

Elevated high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels are not a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. A first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes places the patient at risk for type 2 diabetes, but a grandmother is a second- degree relative. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include age greater than 45 years and a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 or more, Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem.

The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

Because the end product of digestion (glucose) cannot enter cells, glucose builds up in the bloodstream. It is common for the patient with type 1 diabetes to experience weight loss despite consuming large quantities of food (polyphagia). Because glucose cannot enter cells and builds up in the bloodstream, blood becomes hypertonic, and the body tries to get rid of the excess glucose by increasing urine output (polyuria). In reaction to increased excretion of urine, the body again responds by increasing thirst (polydipsia) to replace lost fluids. Because of this, the patient with type 1 diabetes experiences an increase in appetite and weight loss (not weight gain). Even though patients will have an increase in urine output, they will not experience incontinence related to type 1 diabetes."

      "explanation": "Cells use glucose for energy; without endogenous insulin, cells begin to starve. The body responds by sending signals to eat because cells are hungry. Because the end product of digestion (glucose) cannot enter cells, glucose builds up in the bloodstream. It is common for the patient with type 1 diabetes to experience weight loss despite consuming large quantities of food (polyphagia). Because glucose cannot enter cells and builds up in the bloodstream, blood becomes hypertonic, and the body tries to get rid of the excess glucose by increasing urine output (polyuria). In reaction to increased excretion of urine, the body again responds by increasing thirst (polydipsia) to replace lost fluids. Because of this, the patient with type 1 diabetes experiences an increase in appetite and weight loss (not weight gain). Even though patients will have an increase in urine output, they will not experience incontinence related to type 1 diabetes."
