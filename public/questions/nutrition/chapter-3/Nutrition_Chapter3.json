      "question": "Which food is the most abundant dietary source of saturated fats?",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Most saturated fats are of animal origin, coming from foods like red meat and eggs. Olives, fish, and legumes are examples of food sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

      "explanation": "Two important dietary factors that are associated with a higher risk of chronic disease are low intake of omega-3 fats from seafood, which are important components of the diet, and high intake of processed meat. Dairy fats and egg yolks contain saturated fats and cholesterol, which can contribute to a higher risk for chronic disease. Consuming lean poultry and fish is important to reduce the risk of chronic disease. Coconut and palm oils are not considered to be contribute to a higher risk for chronic disease, although they do contain saturated fats derived from plants."

Fats that are liquid at room temperature are high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils and can be consumed as part of a healthy diet. Fatty acids are the basic elements of fats and are consumed with all fats. Animal fats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol and should be limited in the diet."

Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

The appearance of fatty acid chains is marked by a methyl group on the omega end and a carboxylic acid group on the alpha end. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

Eicosanoids also serve as messengers for the central nervous system. The inflammatory response in the body is controlled by eicosanoids. Cellular signaling is controlled by sterols, not eicosanoids. Membrane fluidity is a responsibility of sterols, not eicosanoids."

When hydrogenation occurs, the normal bend of the molecule changes so that hydrogen atoms on either side of the double carbon bond can move to opposite sides. The length of the fatty acid chains are not altered when hydrogenation occurs. When vegetable oils are hydrogenated, the hydrogen atoms are moved to opposite sides of the double carbon bond; they are not moved to the same side of the bond."

      "explanation": "Fat substitutes currently on the market are considered safe by the Food and Drug Administration, but their risks and benefits have not been clearly identified. Caloric intake from any macronutrient source is converted into stored fat throughout the body. As long as adequate amounts of essential fatty acids are in the diet, the body is capable of making other fats and cholesterol as needed. The effects of satiety and improved flavor are partly caused by the slower rate of digestion of fats compared with carbohydrates."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A chylomicron is a lipoprotein formed in the intestinal wall to transport fat to the liver via the lymphatic system. Triglycerides are formed from longer chain fatty acids, not chylomicrons, and glycerol to form new human triglycerides. Bile, not chylomicrons, is released from the gallbladder to emulsify fat. A lipase is a type of enzyme that break down triglycerides to fatty acids and glycerol. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

Cholesterol is a precursor for some hormones, along with serving other important roles in human metabolism. Lipoproteins are the major vehicles for lipid transport in the bloodstream. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Rely on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

Sterols play a variety of important roles, including membrane fluidity and cellular signaling. Eicosanoids signal hormones that exert control over multiple functions in the body and are messengers for the central nervous system. Phospholipids are triglyceride derivatives in which one fatty acid has been replaced with a phosphate group, which allows for cell membrane fluidity.
