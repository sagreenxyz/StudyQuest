        "Red meat"

        "Consuming dairy fats and egg yolks"
      ],
      "correctAnswers": [0, 2, 4],
      "explanation": "Two important dietary factors that are associated with a higher risk of chronic disease are low intake of omega-3 fats from seafood, which are important components of the diet, and high intake of processed meat. Dairy fats and egg yolks contain saturated fats and cholesterol, which can contribute to a higher risk for chronic disease. Consuming lean poultry and fish is important to reduce the risk of chronic disease. Coconut and palm oils are not considered to contribute to a higher risk for chronic disease, although they do contain saturated fats derived from plants."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Partially hydrogenated oils are trans fats with double-bonded structures and are high in hydrogenated unsaturated fats; these should be limited in the diet. Fats that are liquid at room temperature are high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils and can be consumed as part of a healthy diet. Fatty acids are the basic elements of fats and are consumed with all fats. Animal fats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol and should be limited in the diet."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Digestion begins when food enters the oral cavity. Mastication breaks down the food into small particles, and saliva amylase begins to digest carbohydrates. The chewed food forms a ball called a bolus, which passes through the esophagus to the stomach via peristalsis. Once in the stomach, digestive juices kill bacteria, and enzymes break down proteins. The liver secretes bile to break down fats. Next, the pancreas is stimulated, resulting in the secretion of more digestive enzymes. Food mixed with bile from the liver and enzymes from the pancreas enter the small intestine for absorption. The final phase of digestion occurs as indigestible food and water are processed, stored, and dispersed by the large intestine."

A fatty acid that is not completely filled with all of the hydrogen that it can hold is an unsaturated fat. Unsaturated fats are less dense and less heavy than saturated fats.

The micelles allow the products of lipid digestion to travel to the brush border membrane, where fats are absorbed into the epithelial cells of the intestine. Monoglycerides and fatty acids that make it into the intestinal cells via micelle transport reconstruct to form triglycerides. A carrier, chylomicron, packages the triglycerides, along with cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins. Chylomicrons first enter the lacteals, then the lymphatic circulatory system, and then eventually the bloodstream."

When vegetable oils are hydrogenated, the hydrogen atoms on either side of the double carbon bond move to opposite sides from their original location on the same side of the bond. When hydrogenation occurs, the normal bend of the molecule changes so that hydrogen atoms on either side of the double carbon bond can move to opposite sides.

      "explanation": "Lard is made from animal fats, and its use should be limited in cooking to keep foods low in cholesterol. Only animal fats contain cholesterol, so corn oil, soybean oil, and peanut oil are cholesterol-free choices."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Fat substitutes currently on the market are considered safe by the Food and Drug Administration, but their risks and benefits have not been clearly identified. Caloric intake from any macronutrient source is converted into stored fat throughout the body. As long as adequate amounts of essential fatty acids are in the diet, the body is capable of making other fats and cholesterol as needed.

      "options": [
        "Combines with glycerol to form triglycerides",
        "Released from gallbladder to emulsify fat in the small intestine",
        "A lipoprotein formed in the intestine to transport fat to the liver via the lymphatic system",
        "A digestive enzyme that breaks down triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A chylomicron is a lipoprotein formed in the intestinal wall to transport fat to the liver via the lymphatic system. Triglycerides are formed from longer chain fatty acids, not chylomicrons, and glycerol to form new human triglycerides. Bile, not chylomicrons, is released from the gallbladder to emulsify fat. A lipase is a type of enzyme that break down triglycerides to fatty acids and glycerol."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Eicosanoids are signaling hormones in the phospholipid classification that exert control over multiple functions in the body, like inflammatory response, blood clotting, and blood pressure regulation, and serve as a messenger for the central nervous system. Bile is not a phospholipid; it is a substance produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder for use when fat digestion is needed. Lecithin is a major phospholipid that transports fats and cholesterol throughout the body; it does not control body functions. Cholesterol is a member of the sterol classification and is a precursor for some hormones; it does not control body functions. Phytosterols are plant-made sterols that are responsible for membrane fluidity and cellular signaling, not controlling body functions."

Cholesterol is a precursor for some hormones, along with serving other important roles in human metabolism. Lipoproteins are the major vehicles for lipid transport in the bloodstream."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The role of lipoproteins is to combine with triglycerides, proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol, and other fat-soluble substances, allowing fat to travel throughout the bloodstream. Sterols play a variety of important roles, including membrane fluidity and cellular signaling. Eicosanoids signal hormones that exert control over multiple functions in the body and are messengers for the central nervous system. Phospholipids are triglyceride derivatives in which one fatty acid has been replaced with a phosphate group, which allows for cell membrane fluidity."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Trans fatty acids are unnecessary in human nutrition, pose a great number of negative health consequences related to cardiovascular disease, and should be avoided in the diet. Saturated describes the state of being filled; the more filled, the denser the fat is at room temperature. Unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and include the essential fatty acids, which need to be supplied by food for the body. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are the fatty acids that have two or more unfilled spots on the chain."
