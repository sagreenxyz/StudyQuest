        "Hypernatremia",
        "Hyperkalemia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "A patient who has participated in strenuous exercise over several hours is at risk for hyponatremia. Although sweat is relatively low in sodium, prolonged sweating results in sodium loss. The patient is not at risk for hypernatremia in this setting, which typically occurs with inadequate water intake or excessive water loss without replacement. Hypocalcemia is related to conditions such as hypoparathyroidism, malnutrition, or malabsorption. Hyperkalemia is associated with renal impairment or tissue breakdown, whereas sweating is more likely to cause potassium loss and possible hypokalemia."

      "options": [
        "iv) O Hypertension"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Hypertension is associated with excessive sodium intake. Edema is excessive fluid in the extracellular space and is a medical term for swelling. It is not a disease, but a clinical finding. Hypernatremia is not a disease; it is an electrolyte imbalance in which serum sodium is high. Hyperthyroidism is not caused by excessive sodium intake; the most common cause of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune disorder Graves disease."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Chloride helps maintain the body’s acid-base balance. It does not oppose the action of sodium; it has a negatively charged ion that passively follows sodium, which has a positively charged ion. Hydrochloric acid is secreted in gastric juices and kills bacteria in food that enters the stomach. Hydrochloric acid also activates the pepsin enzymes to break down protein. Chloride is only one component of hydrochloric acid."

        "Vomiting"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The primary cause of chloride deficiency is excessive loss of hydrochloric acid through vomiting. Diarrhea results in a loss of several electrolytes, including chloride, but it is not the primary reason for a chloride deficiency. Menkes disease is an inborn error of metabolism that involves copper. A dietary deficiency of chloride does not occur under normal circumstances."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Kashin-Bek disease is caused by selenium deficiency and can lead to heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Balo disease is a rare, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that has no relation to selenium deficiency. Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease and is not caused by selenium deficiency. CREST disease is a connective tissue disordered characterized by changes in the skin, blood vessels, skeletal muscles, and internal organs and has no relationship to selenium deficiency. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

Chromium is an essential component of the organic complex glucose tolerance factor, which stimulates the action of insulin. Selenium is the important part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which protects the lipids in cell membranes from oxidative damage."
