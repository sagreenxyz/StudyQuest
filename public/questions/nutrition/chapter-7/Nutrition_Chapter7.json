      "options": [
        "‘Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables each time you eat.\"",
        "\"You should have a minimum of eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day.\"",

        "\"Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) dietary recommendations.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The best statement a nurse can make when teaching a patient about adequate intake of fruits and vegetables is \"Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables each time you eat.\" This provides a visual measure of how many fruits and vegetables should be on the patient’s plate each time the patient eats. Recommending a minimum of eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day for a patient is excessive. Telling the patient to increase the intake of fruit and vegetables is vague and does not provide guidelines for the patient to follow. Telling a patient to follow the CDC’s dietary recommendations is less helpful because it is not guaranteed that the patient can access or understand the information. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

      "explanation": "Vitamin C prevents iron-deficiency anemia by helping the body absorb nonheme iron, keeping it in its bioactive reduced ferrous form. The vitamin is then made available for hemoglobin production, helping to prevent iron-deficiency anemia. Vitamin C does assist in the metabolism of folate, but folate plays a role in DNA synthesis and cell division, not preventing anemia. Vitamin K is essential in maintaining the normal blood concentrations of four clotting factors. Vitamin C is needed to help convert dopamine into norepinephrine, which are both neurotransmitters.

      "explanation": "The most appropriate statement by the nurse who is providing education for a patient taking high-dose niacin supplements to improve blood lipid profiles is, \"Your liver enzymes must be monitored.\" Liver enzymes need to be periodically checked because of the potential for liver damage from long-term use of high doses of niacin. Flushing of the skin is an adverse, not normal, effect of high-dose niacin. A patient with a niacin deficiency should avoid the sunlight because exposed skin may develop dark, scaly dermatitis.

It is also better to obtain phytonutrients from foods rather than dietary supplements because the beneficial effects of phytochemicals are thought to result from the synergistic actions of multiple constituents as opposed to the action of isolated compounds. Absorption of phytonutrients in the body is not a factor in obtaining phytonutrients. Macronutrients do not contain phytonutrients, but micronutrients do contain phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are not found in abundance in all foods; they are bioactive molecules found in plants. Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the question that was asked? If the question stem asks \"why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural responses.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A patient eating grains and fruits should incorporate vegetables into the diet as well because vegetables have other phytonutrients that benefit health. The patient should be advised to add vegetables to the diet. Substituting more fruits in place of vegetables or encouraging the use of a supplement with the diet will not provide the wide variety of phytonutrients that vegetables will."

      "explanation": "Color is one prominent indicator that a large quantity of a specific phytochemical is present in food. The sources of fruits and vegetables do not correlate with the phytochemicals they contain. An unripe fruit or vegetable may offer fewer phytonutrients, but ripeness does not indicate which phytochemical is present. The category of a food group to which the vegetables and fruits belong does not provide information about the specific phytochemicals they contain."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The best statement a nurse can make when teaching a patient about adequate intake of fruits and vegetables is \"Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables each time you eat.\" This provides a visual measure of how many fruits and vegetables should be on the patient’s plate each time the patient eats. Recommending a minimum of eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day for a patient is excessive. Telling the patient to increase the intake of fruit and vegetables is vague and does not provide guidelines for the patient to follow. Telling a patient to follow the CDC’s dietary recommendations is less helpful because it is not guaranteed that the patient can access or understand the information. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

It is characterized by neuritis, paralysis of the legs and arms, cardiovascular changes, and edema. Vitamin B 2 deficiency places a patient at risk for cracked lips and mouth corners; a swollen, red tongue; burning, itching, or tearing eyes caused by extra blood vessels in the cornea; and a scaly, greasy dermatitis in the skin folds. Vitamin B 6 deficiency can cause abnormal central nervous system function with hyperirritability, neuritis, possible convulsions, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. A deficiency in vitamin B 3 results in weakness, poor appetite, indigestion, and various disorders of the skin and nervous system."
