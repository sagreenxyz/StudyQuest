      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "No restrictions should be placed on the number of times an infant, particularly a newborn, nurses per day, in part because of the supply-and-demand nature of breastfeeding. The infant should not be restricted to four to six or up to 10 feedings per day, nor should the infant be forced to feed at least 12 times per day. Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer. P. 169"

It is always there in the correct form to meet the growing infant's needs. Human milk may not provide sufficient levels of iron and vitamin D after 6 months. The macronutrient content of human milk changes to meet the infant’s needs, but it is not considered a low-fat or low-sugar food. The nutrient contents of human milk and cow’s milk vary considerably.

Low maternal weight gain is a predictor of small-for-gestational-age infants. Anencephaly can result from folate deficiency, not low weight gain. Malformed facial features can result from alcohol use, not low weight gain, during pregnancy. Inadequate fetal bone growth may result from lack of vitamin D, not low weight gain during pregnancy.

      "explanation": "Maternal fatigue and stress may present a challenge to breastfeeding by inhibiting the let-down reflex. Even moderate consumption of alcohol may also inhibit the let-down reflex. A diet consisting of 1600 kcal/day is below the recommended minimum energy intake to sustain adequate lactation. Breast size is not a determinant of successful breastfeeding. The dietary reference intake for vitamin D is the same for lactating and pregnant women. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

Monitoring weight, electrolytes, and fluids is integral in ensuring the nutritional needs are being met.

However, an increase in vitamin D has been known to aid in decreasing gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and a recommended three glasses of vitamin D-fortified milk per day should be included in the diet.

Adolescents are also likely to have many emotional and nutritional risks. Therefore the nurse would concentrate on the patient’s accessibility to the health care provider for prenatal care and socioeconomic status, which would address support, care, and nutritional needs. Also, determining social behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, will help develop a plan to stop these behaviors to prevent low birth weight and infant mortality. Determining how the patient feels about the pregnancy and health status will guide the nurse in determining psychosocial needs. Family history of low-birth-weight births is not directly correlated to the patient’s risk for problems related to pregnancy and birth."

However, some patients experience prolonged severe nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis gravidarum. Patients who have experienced this once are prone to be hospitalized with each subsequent pregnancy. Therefore steps should be implemented to prevent this if possible. Monitoring weight, electrolytes, and fluids is integral in ensuring the nutritional needs are being met. Therefore inquiring as to any food aversions and vomiting will be needed to determine whether nutrition is being maintained. All patients with nausea and vomiting would be advised to avoid smells or triggers that cause nausea and avoid an empty stomach by eating small meals throughout the day.

An overall healthy diet before and during pregnancy containing a high intake of plant- based food, antioxidants, and high fiber is thought to be helpful. However, an increase in vitamin D has been known to aid in decreasing gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and a recommended three glasses of vitamin D-fortified milk per day should be included in the diet. Reducing red meat is not suggested because this is a source of iron. Salt restriction is inappropriate because it does not prevent or help treat symptoms. Adding beans and legumes to each meal is not required, although a routine intake of these foods is good for folate."

The presence of prolactin inhibitors is a factor that may contribute to early cessation of breastfeeding; this is not taken into account when using the Daily Food Plan for Moms.

Colostrum is secreted during the first few days postpartum, not before let- down.

However, an increase in vitamin D has been known to aid in decreasing gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and a recommended three glasses of vitamin D-fortified milk per day should be included in the diet. Reducing red meat is not suggested because this is a source of iron. Salt restriction is inappropriate because it does not prevent or help treat symptoms.

      "explanation": "Human milk changes to meet changing nutrient and energy needs of the newborn and the maturing infant during the first months of life. It is always there in the correct form to meet the growing infant’s needs. Human milk may not provide sufficient levels of iron and vitamin D after 6 months. The macronutrient content of human milk changes to meet the infant’s needs, but it is not considered a low-fat or low-sugar food. The nutrient contents of human milk and cow’s milk vary considerably.

If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural responses.

Although it is important for the mother to worry about where the extra kilocalories are coming from, it is also important to be mindful of weight gain because excessive weight gain can potentially lead to complications for the fetus. During the second trimester, an extra 340 kilocalories per day are needed, not 500 to 700 kilocalories. \"Eating for two\" is a fallacy that can lead to misunderstandings and should not be a phrase nurses use. Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.

      "options": [
        "\"The metabolic workload of the fetus requires increased fuel.\"",
        "\"Added tissue-building requirements need more kilocalories to spare protein.\"",

        "\"Kilocalorie needs during the second and third trimesters do not vary significantly from the first.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "More kilocalories are necessary during the second and third trimesters compared with the first trimester, when the kilocalorie needs are the same as they were before conception. The increased kilocalories are needed to support the increased demands of the metabolic workload of the fetus, added tissue-building requirements, and the increased metabolic workload of the mother."

      "explanation": "Sufficient protein is needed to support amniotic fluid, rapid growth of the fetus, development of a mature placenta to support the fetus, and increased synthesis of hemoglobin and albumin secondary to the increased maternal blood volume required to nourish the fetus and support increased metabolic demands. Vitamin D, not protein, is necessary for supporting absorption and the use of calcium to support fetal bone growth."
