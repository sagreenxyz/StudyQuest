      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "After hemorrhoidectomy, clear fluid diets and fiber-restricted diets will help reduce painful elimination and allow for healing. Nonresidual commercial elemental formulas would help delay bowel movements until the surgical area is healed. It would not be appropriate to recommend immediate medical help. Pain at the surgical site would be normal and an expected finding and should improve as the surgical site heals."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient would receive 365 mL per feeding. The formula to calculate the calorie needs uses kilograms for weight and centimeters for height: [(10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in centimeters) - (5 x age) +5] x injury factor First, convert the patient's weight to kilograms: 215 lb + 2.2 kg/Ib = 97.7 kg And height ft to inches then centimeters: 6 ft x 12 in/ft = 72 in; 72 in x 2.54 cm/in = 182.9 cm. Now, calculate the patient's basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the first part of the formula above: [(10 x 97.7 kg) + (6.25 x 182.9 cm) - (5 x 60 years) + 5] = [977 + 1143 - 300 + 5] = 1825 kcal/day Then, multiple the BMR by the injury factor to calculate the total energy need: 1825 kcal/day x 1.5 = 2737 kcal/day Each nutrition formula has an energy factor. To calculate how much formula is needed for the day, divide the total energy need by the formula's energy factor: 2737 + 1.5 = 1825 mL/day Finally, divide total amount of formula for the day by the number of feedings scheduled: 1825 + 5 = 365"

      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "When a patient has elective surgery, nutrient stores should be built up to prepare for surgery and promote recovery. Nutrient stores to build up include protein, vitamins, and kilocalories. Dehydration may occur if fluids are restricted. Calcium is essential for mineral bone density and should not be decreased.

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The priority course of action for a patient receiving enteral nutrition and experiencing diarrhea is to rule out infection. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a common cause of infection and should be ruled out before stopping enteral feeding, decreasing the rate of feeding, or changing the enteral formula. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response. pp. 422-423"

      "explanation": "Having the patient relax and breathe deeply after each feeding should be implemented for the patient receiving enteral nutrition and experiencing tension and fullness. Chewing sugarless gum will help with thirst and oral dryness. Lifting the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees helps prevent reflux or aspiration. Using continuous feedings instead of bolus feedings is an intervention for a patient with diarrhea."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Full liquid diets contain anything that would melt at room temperature. Foods to suggest to this patient would include ice cream, pudding, and pureed vegetables. Clear broths, strained fruit juices, and popsicles would be recommended for a clear liquid diet. Mashed potatoes, fish, veal, and crackers would be suggested for a patient on a mechanical soft diet. Coffee with cream, frozen yogurt, and cooked cereal would also be recommended for someone on a mechanical soft diet. Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for grammatical inconsistencies. If the response is intended to complete the stem (an incomplete sentence) but makes no grammatical sense to you, it might be a distractor rather than the correct response. Question writers typically try to eliminate these inconsistencies."

      ],
      "explanation": "Observing the patient’s appetite will help the nurse and dietitian adapt the patient’s diet to meet individual needs. Allowing ample time for the patient to chew and between mouthfuls is an important intervention. Depending on the patient’s conditions, having simple conversations with the patient demonstrates interest in the patient and would be beneficial. Lastly, when a patient indicates that they are finished, the assistance should end. The patient should not be forced to eat more. Liquids should be offered between bites of solid food, not while the patient is chewing."

      "explanation": "Parenteral nutrition is recommended for individuals without a functioning lower gastrointestinal system and those with major trauma and burns, intestinal atresia, or severe pancreatitis. A patient with cystic fibrosis, traumatic brain injury, and short gut syndrome with minimal bowel resection would be better candidates for enteral nutrition.

      "explanation": "A gastrectomy is removal of part or all of the stomach. The basic principles of diet therapy for the immediate postgastrectomy period involve both the size of the meals (which should be small and frequent) and the nature of the meals (which are generally simple, easily digested, bland, and low in bulk). Patients may have small frequent meals, as tolerated."

        "\"We need to let your bowels rest, so you are not able to eat or drink anything.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Most patients with burns that cover less than 20% of the total body surface area can consume an oral meal plan that is adequate in nutrient needs. Receiving nutrition through an IV would only be necessary if the patient is unable to consume an adequate amount of nutrients by mouth or if gastrointestinal feedings are not possible. Health care providers resuscitate patients with large amounts of IV fluids and electrolyte therapy during the ebb phase, not the flow phase, to prevent shock. Typically, nutrition therapy begins within 24 to 48 hours after the injury. Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer."

      "explanation": "The ebb phase is the period immediately after a trauma, such as a burn. Burn shock is a condition resulting from the loss of large amounts of fluid that occurs during the first hours until approximately the second day after a burn. To prevent shock, patients should be resuscitated with large amounts of IV fluids and electrolyte therapy. Vitamin C and vitamin A supplements are recommended for patients with burns but would not be the priority during the ebb phase. Adequate energy intake from carbohydrates is important in the recovery of burn patients but is not the top priority during the ebb phase. Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it.

      "explanation": "Some of the biochemical measures used to monitor patients receiving enteral nutrition are glucose, serum electrolytes, and blood urea nitrogen. C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer test, and INR are not monitored in patients receiving enteral nutrition. CRP is used to check for infection or inflammation in the body. D-dimer test is used to monitor blood-clotting issues. INR measures the time for the blood to clot. Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer to a multiple-choice item.

      "explanation": "The patient would receive 365 mL per feeding. The formula to calculate the calorie needs uses kilograms for weight and centimeters for height: [(10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in centimeters) - (5 x age) +5] x injury factor First, convert the patient's weight to kilograms: 215 lb + 2.2 kg/Ib = 97.7 kg And height ft to inches then centimeters: 6 ft x 12 in/ft = 72 in; 72 in x 2.54 cm/in = 182.9 cm. Now, calculate the patient's basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the first part of the formula above: [(10 x 97.7 kg) + (6.25 x 182.9 cm) - (5 x 60 years) + 5] = [977 + 1143 - 300 + 5] = 1825 kcal/day Then, multiple the BMR by the injury factor to calculate the total energy need: 1825 kcal/day x 1.5 = 2737 kcal/day Each nutrition formula has an energy factor. To calculate how much formula is needed for the day, divide the total energy need by the formula's energy factor: 2737 + 1.5 = 1825 mL/day Finally, divide total amount of formula for the day by the number of feedings scheduled: 1825 + 5 = 365"

Enteral nutrition support Is indicated for patients with enough functional gastrointestinal tract to allow adequate digestion and absorption. Parenteral nutrition support is considered when there is a need for bowel rest (e.g., enteral fistulas, acute inflammatory bowel disease). Peripheral parenteral nutrition is indicated when the length of therapy is short, usually up to 14 days. Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered.

Critically ill patients or those who have not been fed enterally for some time will not be able to tolerate large feedings at initiation. Adults who are receiving bolus feedings introduced into the stomach tolerate full-strength formulas initially at a rate of 60 to 120 mL/hr every 8 to 12 hours until the goal volume for nutrient needs are met. The rate of 150 to 520 mL is not applicable to a specific situation.

Depending on the extent of the burn and the associated catabolic losses, individual protein needs vary from 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day in adults and from 2.5 to 4 g/kg/day in children. Adequate energy intake spares protein for tissue rebuilding and meets the increased metabolic demands of the whole body. Approximately 55% to 60% of the total kilocalories should come from carbohydrates, along with a moderate amount of fat (<35% of kcal). Supplementation with vitamin A (10,000 IU/day) and zinc is important for optimal immune function. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be very helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem.

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "High-quality protein intake is crucial to promote early wound healing and support immune function. Individual protein needs vary from 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day to equal 20% to 25% of the total energy intake. Overfeeding the patient is harmful and increases metabolic stress. Approximately 55% to 60% of total kilocalories would come from carbohydrates, not protein. The dietitian will calculate energy needs, which must be reassessed frequently to meet the patient’s changing requirements. Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely.

      "explanation": "It is important for patients to consume optimal amounts of protein during the postoperative period. Immediately following major surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass graft, the body tissues undergo considerable catabolism. In addition to protein lost from the breakdown of tissue, other losses of protein may occur. During wound healing, a patient’s dietary protein needs increase to restore lost protein and to build new tissues at the wound site. Protein and minerals are essential to the foundation of bone formation. Protein is a major component of the body’s immune system. An adequate supply of the plasma protein albumin is necessary to maintain blood volume.

      "options": [
        "Initiate the enteral feeding at a lower rate.",
        "Initiate the enteral feeding at the ordered rate."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "When receiving an order to initiate enteral nutrition via an NG tube for a patient with bowel obstruction, the nurse should discuss the order with the health care provider because enteral nutrition is contraindicated for a patient with a bowel obstruction. The nurse does not have the legal right to change an order but does have a legal obligation to protect the patient from harm. The enteral feeding should not be administered; therefore initiation at a lower rate or the ordered rate and verification of the NG tube placement before feeding are not necessary. Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation."

      "options": [
        "Enterostomy",
        "Esophagostomy",
        "Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy involves placing a tube through the abdominal wall into the stomach and is utilized for a patient who is not at risk for aspiration. A patient who is at risk for aspiration and requires enteral nutritional therapy will need a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy. An enterostomy is the surgical placement of the tube at progressive points along the gastrointestinal tract. An esophagostomy is the creation of an artificial opening in the esophagus at the level of the cervical spine and is used after head and neck surgeries or traumatic injury."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The most appropriate route for short-term enteral therapy is the nasoenteric route. It is passed through the nose into the stomach or small intestine and is indicated for short-term therapy of 6 weeks or less in many clinical situations. An enterostomy is the surgical placement of a tube and is indicated for long-term feedings. Nasojejunal and nasoduodenal routes are types of nasoenteric feeding routes.
