      "explanation": "Lacto-vegetarians will consume protein from dairy products like yogurt. French toast contains egg, which is not consumed by lacto-vegetarians. Scrambled eggs are not consumed by lacto-vegetarians. Chicken is an animal source of protein that is not consumed by lacto-vegetarians. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Protein is used to build special white blood cells such as lymphocytes. Protein helps produce antibodies, not antigens; antibodies defend the body against antigens that cause disease and infections. Passive immunity occurs as a result of the introduction of antibodies from another person. Protein aids in metabolic function through nutrient transport, which occurs during digestion.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The final enzyme in the protein-splitting system is dipeptidase, which is produced in the wall of the small intestine. Trypsin is secreted from the pancreas and works on proteins and large polypeptide fragments that arrive from the stomach. Chymotrypsin is produced by the pancreas and continues the protein-splitting action of trypsin. Aminopeptidase is produced in the wall of the small intestine and attacks the nitrogen-containing end of the peptide chain and releases amino acids one at a time."

        "Excretion",
        "Catabolism",
        "Deamination"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When breaking down protein, the body maintains nitrogen balance through deamination. During deamination, the nitrogen-containing part of the amino group is removed. Anabolism is a process by which amino acids are resynthesized into tissue proteins. The majority of nitrogen is excreted in the form of urea, but the nitrogen must go through a process in the liver to be converted to urea before being excreted. During catabolism, proteins are broken down from a large substance into smaller building blocks. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question. ph 44"

      "explanation": "Conditionally indispensable amino acids are necessary for patients experiencing certain illnesses. The six conditionally indispensable amino acids are normally produced by the body, but in circumstances such as illness, the body cannot make them in high enough quantities. Dispensable amino acids are synthesized by the body and do not have to be consumed on a daily basis. Indispensable amino acids must be obtained by diet because the body does not make adequate amounts to support the body’s needs. A conditionally dispensable amino acid is not a class of amino acids. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Protein helps maintain pH balance by acting as a buffering agent. The unique structure of proteins contains a combination of a carboxyl acid group and a base group, which allow them to act as buffering agents by releasing or taking up excess acid in the body. Protein does not increase the uptake of hydrogen ions, influence the release of carbonic acid, or stimulate the renal system’s uptake of base. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten"

A well-balanced vegetarian diet can meet dietary recommendations for all essential nutrients; therefore vegetarian diets are appropriate throughout all stages of life, including pregnancy. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics notes that plant-based diets are better for the earth than animal-based diets, but this is not the most important factor to consider when choosing to follow a vegetarian diet. A balanced vegetarian eating pattern, along with the body’s small reserve of amino acids, ensures an overall amino acid balance, as long as a sufficient amount of varied foods are consumed to meet the normal nutrient and energy needs."

Switching the child from the nutrient-balanced breast milk to a dilute diet of mostly carbohydrates and small amounts of incomplete protein triggers the condition. Characteristics of kwashiorkor include generalized edema and fatty liver, resulting from inadequate protein availability to maintain fluid balance and transport fat away from the liver. Kwashiorkor results in stunted growth, a weakened immune system, and poor development. Kwashiorkor is a form of PEM that may result from an acute deficiency of protein. It does not result from a chronic deficiency of many nutrients. It is not characterized by an emaciated appearance with little or no body fat.

Dispensable proteins include alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, and serine. Indispensable amino acids are those that cannot be excluded from the diet without compromising health because the body cannot manufacture them in sufficient quantity or at all. These include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.

Protein efficiency ratio rating is based on the weight gain of a growing test animal in relation to its intake of a specific protein source. Indicator amino acid oxidation assumes that when a protein source is deficient in any indispensable amino acid that oxidation of all amino acids will prevent them from contributing to the amino acid pool for protein use in the body. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score is similar to the digestible indispensable amino acid score, but it does not measure the digestibility of each amino acid in the ileum."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The statement, \"Rennin and calcium prevent rapid absorption of milk in an infant\" demonstrates understanding of the role of rennin in protein absorption. Rennin does not speed up the absorption of protein in the stomach. Rennin does not break down protein into amino acids in the stomach; it works with calcium to produce a curd to prevent the food from passing too quickly into the small intestine. Rennin is not present in adolescents; it is only present during infancy and childhood."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Carboxypeptidase is involved in the digestion of protein and is responsible for attacking acid in the small intestine. Enterokinase is secreted by intestinal cells upon food entering the duodenum and activates the enzyme trypsin. Chymotrypsin continues the protein-splitting action of trypsin. Aminopeptidase completes the breakdown of protein and polypeptides and frees the remaining amino acids. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be helpful because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hydrochloric acid is responsible for unfolding and denaturing complex protein chains. Trypsin is an enzyme produced by the pancreas that continues to break down food after it has moved into the small intestine. Pepsin is found in the stomach and is converted to pepsinogen to split the bonds between the protein’s long chain of amino acids, changing the large protein into short chains. Proenzymes are inactive enzymes activated as needed for protein digestion."
