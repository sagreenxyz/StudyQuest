      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "Canned foods are a high-risk food for botulism contamination. Like all clostridia, this species is anaerobic or nearly so. The relatively air-free can and canning temperatures (227°C [80°F]) provide good conditions for toxin production. C. botulinum spores are widespread in soil throughout the world and may accompany harvested food to the food-processing plant. Depending on the dose of toxin consumed and the individual response, symptoms will appear within 18 to 36 hours. Nausea, vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, and slurred speech are typical initial symptoms. The toxin progressively irritates motor nerve cells and blocks the transmission of neural impulses at the nerve terminals, thereby causing a gradual paralysis."

      "explanation": "%DV is how much a nutrient in a single serving of an individual packaged food or dietary supplement contributes to your daily diet. DVs are reference values that relate the nutrition information to a total daily diet of 2000 kcal, which is appropriate for most women, teenage girls, and some sedentary men. The footnote indicates the daily values for a 2500-kcal diet, which meets the needs of most men, teenage boys, and active women. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

        "A physician statement must accompany the claim and define the risk."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The FDA strictly regulates health claims that link nutrients or food groups with a risk for disease. A physician statement must accompany the claim and define the risk for the disease. Health claims may appear on the front, side, or back of the food package. To make an association between a food product and a specific disease, the FDA must approve both the claim and the wording used on the package. Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and in an area as complex as nursing, an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices."

      "explanation": "The EDA is charged with ensuring that the United States’ food supply is safe by enforcing food sanitation and quality control, governing food additives, regulating the movement of foods across state lines, supervising the nutrition labeling of foods, and ensuring the safety of public food service. The FTC regulates the advertising and truthful marketing of food products. The CDC monitors and investigates cases of foodborne illnesses. The Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA is responsible for food safety of both domestic and imported meat, poultry, and processed egg products. Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong answer. Example: [f you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie diet). pp. 211, 212"

      "explanation": "Symptoms of foodborne illness can appear 1 to 6 hours after eating contaminated food. The time spans of 2 to 4 hours, 1 to 3 hours, and 2 to 5 hours do not cover the full possible span of 1 to 6 hours. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Handwashing with soap and water before meals is important advice to prevent foodborne illness. Clean hands help prevent the spread of bacteria from the hands to the food in the meal. Handwashing after eating will not prevent foodborne illness. Washing the surfaces of countertops is important, but hand hygiene is a greater priority in preventing foodborne illness. Heating all lunch meats to steaming is advice given to pregnant women to prevent infection with Listeria organisms. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The nurse suspects the patient is infected with E. coli. E. coli infection can cause bloody diarrhea and fever and sometimes progresses to renal failure and death. Most outbreaks arise from consumption of unpasteurized or undercooked food or contaminated water. Salmonella infection is associated with the consumption of eggs, milk, custard, sandwich fillings, shellfish, and contaminated water, producing bloody diarrhea with fever. Campylobacter infection causes acute diarrhea and is linked to the consumption of undercooked meats and seafood, raw milk, and untreated water. Listeria usually infects people with suppressed immunity and has been traced to unpasteurized milk, undercooked poultry, and processed meats."

Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

Depending on the dose of toxin consumed and the individual response, symptoms will appear within 18 to 36 hours. Nausea, vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, and slurred speech are typical symptoms. The toxin progressively irritates motor nerve cells and blocks the transmission of neural impulses at the nerve terminals, thereby causing a gradual paralysis. Escherichia coli usually has symptoms of low-grade fever, stomach cramps, and diarrhea that resolves within 7 days. Staphylococcus aureus symptoms usually appear suddenly, within 1 to 6 hours of ingestion and include nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, and sweating. Recovery is usually rapid.

Symptoms usually include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and blood or mucus in the stool, and shigellosis is usually confined to the large intestine. Listeriosis produces similar symptoms but is not usually confined to the large intestine. Salmonellosis also may be demonstrated with similar symptoms but is not usually confined to the large intestine. Staphylococcal food poisoning leads to similar symptoms as shigellosis, but is not usually confined to the large intestine.

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The nurse suspects the patient is infected with E. coli. E. coli infection can cause bloody diarrhea and fever and sometimes progresses to renal failure and death. Most outbreaks arise from consumption of unpasteurized or undercooked food or contaminated water. Salmonella infection is associated with the consumption of eggs, milk, custard, sandwich fillings, shellfish, and contaminated water, producing bloody diarrhea with fever. Campylobacter infection causes acute diarrhea and is linked to the consumption of undercooked meats and seafood, raw milk, and untreated water. Listeria usually infects people with suppressed immunity and has been traced to unpasteurized milk, undercooked poultry, and processed meats."

The symptoms of foodborne illness are often difficult to distinguish from other forms of illness. Most forms of foodborne illness are short-lived and self-limiting. Even if the person sees a physician, identifying the pathogen responsible is difficult. The CDC tracks, investigates, and reports the incidence of foodborne illness, but its ability to do so is dependent on the victim. Local, state, and tribal health departments voluntarily report foodborne illness to the CDC."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The symptoms of foodborne illnesses can mimic those associated with the flu or other temporary gastrointestinal illnesses, and people may not seek medical care or report the issue, which makes identifying outbreaks difficult. Symptoms of foodborne illness occur generally within 12 to 24 hours of eating the offending item. Although many foods can cause foodborne illnesses, there are common culprits implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coordinates investigations into foodborne illness outbreaks. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

Organic plant foods grow without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms, or ionizing radiation. Consumers of organic foods cite that organically grown food has increased nutrient value, but that has not been proven. Organic farming may be more beneficial for the environment but has lower crop yield, requires more land, and is more expensive than conventionally grown crops. lonizing radiation is not used in organic farming.

Three landmark reports that related nutrition and diet to national health goals reinforced the need to reorganize the entire food-labeling system. Those reports were the Surgeon General’s Report on Nutrition and Health, The National Research Council’s Diet and Health Report, and the health and objectives defined in Healthy Peoples Initiative. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Research Service did not create a report to reinforce the need to reorganize the food labeling system.

      "explanation": "Many food manufacturers use front-of-package labeling to broadcast nutrition information. Currently, there are few federal regulations in place to standardize front-of-package labels. Ideally, front-of-package labeling would be symbolic instead of text heavy and visually easy to interpret. Studies indicate that graded summary labels, such as multiple traffic-light labels, Nutri-Score labels, or the 5-Color Nutrition Label, are the most well accepted and comprehensive way to help individuals identify healthier food options.
