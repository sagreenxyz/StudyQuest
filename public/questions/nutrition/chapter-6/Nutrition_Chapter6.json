      "explanation": "Electrical energy is required for the involuntary operations that take place in the brain and nerves. Chemical energy is primarily used in various metabolic processes in the body, not in the brain and nerves. Mechanical energy is used for actions like muscle contractions. Thermal energy is used to regulate body temperature. Test-Taking Tip: Because few things in life are absolute without exceptions, avoid selecting answers that include words such as always, never, all, every, and none. Answers containing these key words are rarely correct."

Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

Body energy output that exceeds food energy input also leads to energy imbalance and possible extreme and unhealthy weight loss. Thermic energy is the extra energy required by the body for physical processes related to digestion, absorption, and transportation of nutrients. Reduction of this energy will not maintain energy balance in the body."

It is also referred to as the basal metabolic rate. It is expressed in kilocalories per day. The increase in energy expenditure caused by the activities of digestion, absorption, transport, and metabolism of ingested food is the thermic effect of food. The amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life at rest over a 24-hour period is the REE. It is often used interchangeably with the term basal energy expenditure, but in actuality it is slightly higher because the protocol for measurement does not put the person at complete rest. TEE of an individual is the sum of the BEE, energy needs for physical activities, and the thermic effect of food."

The TEE formula requires the clinician to convert height to cm (2.54 cm = 1 in) and weight to kg (2.2 Ib = 1 kg). Patient’s height in inches: (5 ft x 12 in/ft) +10 in = 70 in Patient’s height in cm: 70 in x 2.54 cm/in = 177.8 cm Patient’s weight in kg: 190 Ib x 2.2 Ib/kg = 86.36 kg Multiply the patient’s height, weight, and age to the respective numbers in the formula before adding height and weight together and subtract the age total. Then complete the formula by multiplying the total by the PA (moderately active). TEE = [66.47 + (5 x 177.8 cm) + (13.75 x 86.36) - (6.755 x 57)] x 1.55 = TEE = (66.47 + 889 + 1187.45 - 385.035) x 1.55 = TEE = 1757.885 x 1.55 = 2724.72 rounded to the nearest whole number = 2725 kcal/day"

      "question": "A patient admitted to an inpatient unit was diagnosed with cachexia. Which source of stored energy is the patient’s body most likely using to maintain central nervous system function?",
      "options": [

        "Glycogen stored in the liver",
        "Glycogen reserve in muscle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The need for glucose to fuel the central nervous system results in loss of body protein from muscle mass when energy and carbohydrate intakes are inadequate, especially in the case of cachexia. The supply of adipose tissue varies from person to person and is not the source of energy this patient’s body would use. Glycogen reserves in the liver and muscle are depleted quickly and are not the source of stored energy the patient’s body would use. Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no pattern to the answers."
