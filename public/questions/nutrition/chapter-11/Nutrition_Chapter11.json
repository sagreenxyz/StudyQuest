      "explanation": "Age is one of the basic indicators of readiness for solid foods. At approximately 6 months of age, an infant can have iron-fortified solid foods added to the basic diet of breast milk. Four months is too early to introduce an infant to iron-fortified solid foods. It is safe for infants to have solid foods prior to 8 and 10 months."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Breast milk is the ideal first food for infants, and it is the primary recommendation of pediatricians and dietitians. Cow’s milk should never be given to an infant in the first year of life. A human milk fortifier is used only as a supplement to breast milk. Breast milk substitute is an acceptable alternative to breast milk, but research has shown that many mothers do not adhere to the recommended safety precautions when preparing infant formula."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The statement by the nurse that the percentile will help follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with that of other infant girls is correct because growth charts allow the health care provider to compare the growth rate with that of other healthy infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how tall the infant will be as an adult is incorrect because growth charts do not predict adult height. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will help to follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with other infants of her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared with other infants of the same sex, not all infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how long the infant is compared with other healthy and well-nourished infants of her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared with other infants of the same sex, not all infants. Rationale The statement by the nurse that the percentile will help follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with that of other infant girls is correct because growth charts allow the health care provider to compare the growth rate with that of other healthy infants.

      "explanation": "Food jags are brief sprees or binges of eating one particular food, seen in preschool-aged children and a frequent source of concern and frustration for caregivers. Low appetite and susceptibility to distractions while eating are seen in toddlers age 1 to 3 years. Preschool-aged children prefer to eat in groups because eating becomes a source of socialization. Their food preferences will be reflective of the social group’s likes and dislikes of various foods."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "At 4 to 6 months, the infant changes from a suckling pattern to a mature and stronger suck with liquids and begins a munching pattern. This change is not observed at 1 to 3 months when rooting and sucking reflexes are present. At 7 to 9 months, the infant will begin chewing solid foods and will have matured from the simple munching patterns. At 10 to 12 months, the infant is old enough to reach for spoons, bite nipples, and crunch foods. This is also beyond the simple munching pattern. Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the question that was asked? If the question stem asks \"why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal the correct answer."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Levels of growth hormones and sex hormones rise during adolescence. Adulthood is the final phase of a normal life cycle, during which physical growth plateaus. Rise of growth hormones or sex hormones does not occur during this period. Infancy refers to the first year of life during which the highest rate of growth of the entire life cycle occurs. However, sex hormones do not develop during this period. During childhood (between infancy and adolescence), the growth rate slows and becomes irregular. There is no rise in levels of growth hormones or sex hormones during this period. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "School-aged children (age 5 to 12 years) have slow and irregular physical growth, but cognitive, emotional, and social growth are extensive during this developmental state. Food jags are common during the preschool- aged years (age 3 to 5 years). Appetites usually slow down along with growth rates during the toddler years. Children continue to form eating patterns, attitudes, and basic eating habits because of social and emotional experiences involving food during the preschool-aged years. Test-Taking Tip: Watch for grammatical inconsistencies. If one or more of the options is not grammatically consistent with the stem, the alert test taker can identify it as a probable incorrect option.

        "Allow the infant to have a bottle when sleeping but only after age 6 months"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Safety regarding feeding an infant is important in the discharge planning of new mothers. The nurse would teach the new mother to tilt the bottle to keep the nipple full of milk, which can prevent the infant from swallowing air. Formula can be either cold or warm. Caregivers should be discouraged from propping the bottle. Infants and children should never sleep with a bottle of milk that is capable of pooling in the mouth because it could lead to tooth decay. Test-Taking Tip: Do not select answers that contain exceptions to the general rule, controversial material, or degrading responses."

      "question": "Which nutrient is the preferred source of energy for the body during a child’s growth spurt?",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Carbohydrates are the preferred source of energy for the body, particularly for a child experiencing a growth spurt who needs greater calories to support tissue growth. Fat is a backup energy source and supplies the essential fatty acids necessary for growth. Protein supports growth instead of providing energy. Calcium is a necessary nutrient for proper bone growth but does not supply energy to the body. Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely. Example: If the answer you are seeking is directed to a specific treatment and all but one option deal with signs and symptoms, you would be correct in choosing the treatment-specific option."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Growth is greatest within the first 6 months of life. The onset of puberty begins the second stage of rapid growth, which continues into adulthood. Rapid growth occurs within the first year of life, but the greatest growth occurs during the first 6 months of life. Between infancy and adolescence, the childhood growth rate slows and becomes irregular. Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong answer. Example: If you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie diet)."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "During the first year of life, an infant is expected to triple their birth weight and increase in length by 50%. Tripling their birth weight and increasing in length by 25% is not enough of an increase in length. Doubling their birth weight and increasing length by 25% is not enough of an increase in weight or length. Doubling their birth weight and increasing in length by 50% is less than the expected tripling of weight during the first year of life."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Although cow’s milk is a source of several important nutrients, it is a poor source of iron. The toddler who consumes excessive amounts of cow’s milk in place of meals and snacks is at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Infants and children are innately capable of recognizing satiety and self-regulating energy balance when offered a healthy diet, so they are less at risk for obesity. In pediatrics, the term failure to thrive is used to describe infants, children, or adolescents who do not grow and develop normally. Food insecurity occurs when there is a limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or there is a limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways."

Vitamin K is critical for blood clotting; a major contributor to the daily supply of vitamin K is provided by bacterial production in the gut. Because infants are born without bacterial flora, their vitamin K synthesis and stores are minimal. There is a concern for a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and low levels of vitamin D in breast milk; this is why vitamin D also may be necessary in supplemental form. Infants are not deficient in vitamins C and A. Pregnant women may require folate, but infants do not. Infants do not require supplemental iron and vitamin B."

Girls who are obese are more likely to progress through puberty at an earlier age than girls at a normal weight. Because the velocity of growth and onset of puberty can vary greatly, biologic age is a better indicator of nutrition needs than chronologic age. Early menarche is associated with adult obesity and increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The iron content of breast milk is highly absorbable and fully meets the needs of an infant for the first 6 months of life. At that point, the infant’s nutrition needs for iron typically exceed that provided exclusively by breast milk. Therefore the addition of solid foods (e.g., enriched cereal, meat, egg yolks) at approximately 6 months of age and beyond provides additional iron. Breastfeeding alone after age 6 months will not provide adequate iron. It is not that the baby has no iron stores but that they require more iron than breast milk offers. Increasing iron in the mother’s diet will not be sufficient for the baby. Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important. Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong response.

      "explanation": "The best response is \"This is normal behavior for a preschool-aged child.\" A food jag is a brief spree of binging or eating one particular food. Food jags are not uncommon in the preschool age group (3 to 5 years old). A jag may last a few days or weeks, and they are usually self-limiting and of no major long-term concern. There is no need to caution the parent to stop giving the child crackers. Asking if the child is watching too much television addresses screen time, not diet. There should be no immediate concern that the child is not eating a balanced diet. A recommendation to continue to offer a variety of foods with the crackers, provide small portions, and offer frequent nutritious snacks are all appropriate for this child."

Endocrine disease, intestinal obstruction, and dilution of ready-to-feed formula can place an infant at risk for failure to thrive. Extrusion reflex is the normal early infant reflex to protrude the tongue outward when it is touched. It disappears at approximately 6 months of age.

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The safest method of introducing highly allergenic foods (e.g., cow’s milk, tree nuts, peanuts) into the diet of infants and children is to introduce the food as a complementary food once a few traditional first foods have been tolerated. It is appropriate to introduce highly allergenic foods, which include cow’s milk, wheat, and other dairy products, during the first year of life; it is unnecessary to wait for preschool. The food should be introduced in smaller-than-normal amounts so that if an adverse reaction occurs, the offending food can be easily identified. Introducing highly allergenic foods at home first is safer than doing so at a daycare center or a restaurant.

There is no known risk for allergic reaction to human breast milk from a milk bank.

Infants whose birth weight is at or above the 90th percentile for their age and sex are considered large for gestational age."

      "explanation": "During the first 3 years of life, children need between 80 and 120 kcal/kg/day to support their rapid growth. The demand for energy, as measured in kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day, is relatively large throughout infancy and childhood. The energy needs of a premature infant range from 110 to 135 kcal/kg/day. The energy needs of an adult range from 30 to 40 kcal/kg/day, and the energy needs of an adolescent range from 50 to 80 kcal/kg/day."

Because the velocity of growth and onset of puberty can vary greatly, biologic age is a better indicator of nutrition needs than chronologic age. Early menarche is associated with adult obesity and increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

The baby's head should be slightly elevated during feeding to facilitate the passage of milk into the stomach. A bottle used as a pacifier during bedtime causes milk to pool in the mouth, resulting in baby bottle tooth decay. Caregivers should be encouraged to never prop the bottle or leave the baby alone to feed, especially at bedtime. This will deprive the baby of the cuddling that is essential for nurturing and will allow milk to pool in the mouth, leading to choking, earache, or early childhood caries."

Good bone density requires an ample dietary supply of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, protein, and several other nutrients. Dairy foods provide all of these nutrients and are the main source of calcium for children, so a diet low in dairy due to an allergy may affect peak bone mass as an adult. A vegetarian diet as a preschooler may affect peak bone mass as an adult if the diet does not contain adequate calcium and protein."
