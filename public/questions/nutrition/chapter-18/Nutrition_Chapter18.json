      "options": [
        "Patients with CF should receive a liquid diet to rest the bowel."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The focus of nutritional intervention for patients with CF include increased calorie intake, increased fat intake, and maintenance of lean body mass. Dietary recommended intakes (DRIs) for patients with CF over 2 years of age may require more nutrients (110% to 200%) depending on the severity of the disease. A liquid diet would not provide enough nutritional value, and bowel rest is not necessary for cystic fibrosis. Patients with cystic fibrosis should receive three meals and two to three snacks per day."

      "question": "The nurse admits a patient to the medical floor with a diagnosis of cholecystitis and cholelithiasis. Which diet order does the nurse anticipate will help decrease the patient’s symptoms?",
      "options": [
        "Low-carbohydrate",
        "low-sodium"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Cholecystitis with cholelithiasis is inflammation of the gallbladder with gall stones. As fat enters the intestine, the hormone cholecystokinin triggers gallbladder contractions to release bile. Cholecystitis with cholelithiasis causes pain during normal contraction of the gallbladder; therefore a low-fat diet is appropriate. A low- carbohydrate diet is often prescribed for patients with diabetes mellitus. A low-sodium diet is appropriate for patients with hypertension or fluid-retaining disorders. A high-protein diet may be necessary for patients with cystic fibrosis. Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are very similar. This can be helpful because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too, pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur."

      "explanation": "A severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction as described is called anaphylacticshock. An allergy is a state of hypersensitivity to a particular substance in the environment that produces problems in the functioning of affected tissues. An adverse reaction is usually attributed to unintended effects of medications. A sentinel event is an unanticipated event in the health care setting that results in severe psychological distress, serious physical injury, or death."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Patients with allergies should avoid offending foods to decrease risk for adverse reactions. Patients with food allergies should substitute offending foods with nutritionally appropriate alternatives. Babies exclusively breastfed have a reduction of food allergies. Children tend to outgrow food allergies."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "In the discharge plan of care for the patient diagnosed with xerostomia, the nurse should instruct the patient to maintain regular dental appointments. Xerostomia is chronic dry mouth and can cause tooth decay. Avoiding extremes in food temperature is more applicable to a patient with mouth ulcers. There is no reason a patient with xerostomia should be on a mechanical soft diet; this may be helpful for a patient with tooth loss or lacking teeth. Additional gravies and sauces on food may help facilitate the eating process."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The nurse’s best response to the patient is \"They are caused by a bacteria known as hemolytic Streptococcus.\" A canker sore is not caused by lack of oral hygiene. Herpes simplex virus does not cause canker sores, but it does cause mouth sores known as cold sores or fever blisters on the inside mucous lining of the lips and cheeks or on the external portion of the lips. Thrush is caused by the fungus Candida albicans, which can cause similar sores on the oral mucosa."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "A mechanical soft diet will be ordered for a patient who has inadequate dentition. All foods in a mechanical diet require less chewing than a regular diet, and the foods are soft-cooked and the meats are ground. A pureed diet requires no chewing and consists of food that is blended and prepared with added liquids to form a soft, smooth, thick paste, which is not necessary for a patient who has inadequate dentition. A full-liquid diet is used to transition between a clear and soft diet. A regular diet may be difficult for the patient with inadequate dentition to chew."

Blurry vision is not a common symptom associated with an allergic reaction. Ringing in the ears may occur with a reaction to aspirin, not food. Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only some of the options may relate directly to the situation."

      "options": [
        "Low-protein, low-calorie"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "A patient experiencing watery diarrhea caused by Crohn's disease would benefit from increased proteins and calories, low fats and lactose, and avoidance of foods that stimulate peristalsis. Increased protein will help the patient’s overall strength and nutritional health. Increasing carbohydrates but reducing protein is not best for this patient. Increasing fiber is not enough for this patient. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."

      "options": [
        "DASH diet"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Celiac disease is a digestive disease that damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food. A patient with celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten-containing foods because the immune system responds by damaging or destroying villi lining the small intestine. Therefore a patient with celiac disease should be prescribed a gluten-free diet. The DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) diet is for patients with hypertension. Carbohydrate-counting is an appropriate diet for a diabetic patient. A high-fiber diet is prescribed for patients with chronic constipation or for those with diverticulosis."

      "question": "A toddler develops hives, nausea, and diarrhea after eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, apple slices, and milk for lunch. The toddler’s mother asks the nurse if the child’s symptoms are caused by a peanut allergy. What is the nurse’s best response?",
      "options": [
        "\"tis probably an allergy to peanuts. It is a common problem in children.\"",
        "\"lhave no idea what is wrong with your child. It doesn’t sound like an allergy.\"",

        "identify your child’s allergens.\"",
        "\"Iwill ask the pediatrician to come in and talk to you about peanut allergies.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The best response by the nurse is, \"It is difficult to tell. Your child’s pediatrician ordered a skin prick test and some lab work to help identify your child’s allergens.\" The nurse is answering the parent with the most accurate information. Stating that it is probably an allergy to peanuts is not the best way to respond. The child also ate milk and wheat, which are common allergens. It is inappropriate for the nurse to respond that they have no idea because the mother is looking to the nurse for information and guidance. In addition, stating \"It doesn’t sound like an allergy\" is inaccurate because the signs and symptoms displayed by the toddler are common with food allergies. Stating that the nurse will ask the pediatrician to speak with the mother about peanut allergies is inappropriate because the allergen has not been determined. Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are incorrect."

        "Restrict sodium intake.",
        "Consume low-fat foods.",
        "Increase intake of water-soluble vitamins."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Use of pancreatic enzyme supplementation should be included in the teaching for a patient with cystic fibrosis. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is necessary for the digestion of foods. Sodium intake does not have to be restricted. The disease process inhibits the normal movement of sodium ions in the body tissue, so sodium depletion occurs through an increased salt concentration in body perspiration. The patient’s diet is unrestricted and should include high-fat foods because of malabsorption syndrome that occurs as a result of the disease process. Vitamin supplementation is important, but it is unnecessary for increasing the intake of water-soluble vitamins. Supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins is significantly important because of pancreatic insufficiency. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

      "explanation": "The nurse should provide low-fat meals to patients with IBD during periods of inflammation. Foods high in fat can cause gas and diarrhea during periods of inflammation caused by inadequate absorption of fat. High- fiber meals should be avoided during periods of inflammation. Increasing antioxidant intake is initiated during the period of remission. Total parenteral nutrition is initiated only if necessary."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "When providing nutrition to a severely malnourished patient, the nurse should monitor the patient for refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome is a fatal metabolic disturbance that involves fluid and electrolyte imbalances and can result in cardiac arrest. Tetany is a result of low levels of calcium that can occur in chronic nutritional deficiency. Dysphagia is a chronic swallowing disorder; it is not a complication of providing nutrition to a severely malnourished patient. Cardiospasm is a condition that is medically termed achalasia and is a disorder in the esophagus. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

Anesthesia received during the surgery, immobility after the surgery, and the use of pain medications put this patient at highest risk. The patient who is recovering from brain surgery may also be at risk, but the patient is lowering the risk by ambulating. The patient with anxiety is consuming an adequate amount of fluids, which will help to lessen the risk.

Increasing fiber is not enough for this patient. Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly answering each question."
