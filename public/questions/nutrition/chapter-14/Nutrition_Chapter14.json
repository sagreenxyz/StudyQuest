      "explanation": "Traditional meal patterns in a Mexican diet focus on lunch as the largest meal of the day, with a lighter breakfast and dinner. Brunch is not part of a traditional meal pattern in a Mexican diet. Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in one or two of the options .

      "options": [],
      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "Advertising strategies that use brand mascots and cartoon media characters on food packaging greatly affect children’s eating patterns by increasing the preference for products bearing the familiar character logo. Because fresh fruits and vegetables are not processed or packaged, they rarely include such logos. Hence their consumption by children are rarely affected by marketing influences. Foods such as cereal, candies, and carbonated drinks often use brand mascots and cartoon media characters on their packaging, which affects children’s preference for these items."

      "explanation": "At the end of Ramadan, during Eid-al-Fitr, a whole lamb is served as a symbol of sacrifice. Veal is served during Eid-al-Fitr, but it does not represent sacrifice; it is one of the many delicacies symbolizing the joy of returning from fasting. Rich pastries and other sweets conclude the post-Ramadan meal symbolizing the joy of returning from fasting and the heightened sense of unity, goodwill, and charity that the fasting experience has brought to the people. Chicken is served during Eid-al-Fitr, but it does not represent sacrifice; it is one of the many delicacies symbolizing the joy of returning from fasting.

French Americans have contributed a unique cuisine by developing a distinctive food pattern from the available seafood and from what they could grow and harvest; this is not considered \"soul food.\" Central Americans did not introduce \"soul food\"; their dishes center on corn, tomatoes, squashes, chilies, avocado, rice, legumes, and various fruits; they also have Asian, European, and African influences."

      "explanation": "Jewish dietary laws allow the consumption of meats that come from animals that chew their cud and that have cloven hooves such as beef, dairy products, and eggs. However, kosher laws do not permit consumption of meat and milk products at the same meal or prepared with the same dishes.

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Advertising strategies that use brand mascots and cartoon media characters on food packages greatly affect children’s eating patterns by increasing the preference for products bearing the familiar character logo. Television advertising can play a part in children’s food choices, but using mascots and cartoon characters on food packaging are directly aimed at children. Children are not usually affected by marketing at the grocery store because most marketing is targeted to the adult shoppers. Fresh fruits and vegetables are not processed or packaged and rarely have any type of advertising logo. Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong answer. Example: [f you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie diet)."

      "explanation": "Americans are eating out more frequently than in the past because of changing family structures and time constraints. Unhealthy food choices may be easier and quicker for families on the run. The number of women in the workforce has increased over the years, decreasing the time available for planning, preparing, and cooking healthy meals. Subsequently, food is prepared and consumed outside the home and may not have the nutrition value of a home-cooked meal. Because women are working outside the home, they have less time to spend on preparing and cooking meals, resulting in fast-food choices or other less nutritious meals. Often, women are the primary or sole earners in the household and may rely on meals that are less expensive, often having less nutritional value. Food items and cooking methods that save time, space, and labor are important for American households because of convenience; this often results in unhealthy food habits."

As people have crossed borders and brought traditions and food cultures with them, there has been an increased availability of various ethnic food markets and restaurants; this is a result of the reduction of geographic and ethnic boundaries, not a factor causing it."

      "options": [],
      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "Portion sizes of processed foods have increased substantially, leading Americans to overeat because serving sizes are unnecessarily large; most consumers continue to eat and drink relative to the amount of food and beverage served instead of in response to their actual hunger and energy needs. Fast-food menu options have increased and are less healthy because of significant increase in energy content and sodium content; this is problematic because of the frequency with which Americans dine at fast-food restaurants. Family structures have changed, and women currently make up nearly 47% of the workforce in the United States; working parents rely on food items and cooking methods that save time, space, and labor. Although research shows that family meals have many benefits, families rarely sit down to eat meals together. Structured mealtimes have decreased, not increased, over the past 40 years, leading in part to unhealthy snacking."

      "explanation": "Food or food advice is readily accepted from friends and acquaintances and can have an influence on personal food habits. A type of food used as a \"treat\" to distract a child is often recalled by the adult who will use this comfort food to cope with stress. Food is a symbol of acceptance, warmth, and friendliness in social relationships and can have a positive influence on personal food habits. During adulthood, certain foods may trigger a flood of childhood memories; these triggers of family sentiments stay with people throughout their lives. Religious dietary laws, not family relationships, determine which foods should be consumed or avoided for religious purposes."

Environmental and societal influences are main factors in personal food choices according to a biopsychosocial model. Ethnic and regional cultural practices influence the establishment of food traditions early in life, which influence individual food choices. The behavioral environment, including family relationships, is a main influence on personal food choices, according to a biopsychosocial model. Food neophobia is not one of the main influences on individual food choices; it is a normal developmental trait from the evolutionary past that protected children from eating harmful foods."

      "explanation": "Understanding proper portion size is important when planning meals and buying in bulk; often food purchased this way has spoiled before it has been used. A patient must be educated on the correct way to purchase food in bulk to buy the proper amount and consume it before it spoils. When purchasing in large quantities, it is important to store food properly so that it maintains its freshness for later use. It is not necessary to avoid warehouse stores, but the patient should be educated on how to properly plan to use large quantities efficiently. Snack items purchased at warehouse clubs are often high in added sugars, sodium, saturated fat, and overall calories; this should be considered but does not necessarily require all snacks to be avoided."

Poverty and high cost of a healthy diet are the leading causes of food insecurity for many American families. Limited agricultural produce and influence of social media are not leading causes of food insecurity in America. High taxation on \"junk food\" is not a cause of food insecurity either. In fact, it is expected that a high taxation on such foods will help decrease the consumption of such foods and subsidize the cost of healthy choices."

      "explanation": "When providing dietary counseling for a Hispanic patient who consumes traditional Mexican foods, the nurse should consider recommending cheese in order to help meet the RDA for calcium. There is a high prevalence of lactose intolerance in the Mexican population, which limits the intake of large quantities of milk products. Cheese is a dairy food group that may be easier to tolerate and can be utilized frequently in the diet. Milk, yogurt, and low-fat milk are less easy to tolerate and are generally not consumed in large amounts in the Hispanic culture. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."
