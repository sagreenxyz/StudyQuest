        "‘Select a sports drink that has optimal gastric emptying and intestinal absorption times."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When using a sports drink to supplement fluid loss, it is important to select one that has optimal gastric emptying and intestinal absorption times in order for it to be most effective. Water is the best solution for regular needs, but athletes who are engaged in longer and demanding endurance events may benefit from a sports drink. Fluid-replacement strategies should be implemented during exercise to prevent the symptoms of dehydration. It is difficult to measure the extent of dehydration; it is appropriate to use a sports drink before symptoms of dehydration are evident. Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are incorrect."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The Cunningham equation is one method used to calculate basic energy needs. Kilocalories per hour is used to calculate energy expenditure, not energy needs. Peak oxygen uptake assists in determining the intensity and duration of exercise that a person can perform. Target heart rate is used to determine the appropriate heart rate to maximize aerobic benefits of exercise."

      "question": "a According to Healthy People 2020, adults should perform muscle-strengthening activities at least how many days per week? Ol TOR: O®> Q7",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Adults should perform moderate- or high-intensity muscle-strengthening activities that involve all major muscle groups at least twice a week because these activities provide additional health benefits. Once a week is not enough. Five and seven times per week are more than necessary. Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Resistance training creates and maintains muscle and bone strength. Activities of daily living do not reach aerobic levels but should still be incorporated into daily life. Aerobic exercises can be sustained at a necessary level of intensity to provide aerobic benefits. Weight-bearing exercises are important for bone structure and strength. In these exercises, muscles are working against gravity, but they do not create muscle and bone strength."

        "Carbohydrates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Carbohydrates are the chief macronutrient for energy support throughout exercise because they are the only available energy source for anaerobic fuel. Fatty acids serve as a fuel source from dietary intake and adipose tissue, but they are not the main source of energy. Water is not classified as a macronutrient. Protein makes a relatively insignificant and inefficient contribution to energy during exercise under normal circumstances."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "One hundred and fifty minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, or 75 to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, is the minimum recommended amount of exercise for an adult. Forty-five minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per day is equal to 315 minutes a week, almost double the minimum recommendation. One hundred minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity is less than the minimum level of physical activity recommended. One hundred and seventy-five minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity is above the recommended minimum level of activity. Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details.

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Aerobic conditioning is an excellent exercise to strengthen the heart muscle, enabling it to pump more efficiently. Yoga is a flexibility activity that typically does not raise the heart rate to a level that increases aerobic capacity. Stretching is a flexibility activity that typically does not raise the heart rate to a level that increases aerobic capacity. Resistance training is a muscle strengthening activity that is not considered an aerobic activity."

      "options": [
        "Weekly balance training for all adults."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "Increased participation in regular physical activity is the overall national health goal, encouraging adults to move more and sit less. Balance training is recommended for older adults, along with aerobic and muscle- strengthening activities. The recommendation for muscle-strengthening activities is dependent on the age group. Vigorous-intensity aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week, and the amount is dependent on the age group."

      "question": "How many grams of carbohydrates are needed for high-intensity or endurance exercise lasting more than 1 hour?",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "For activities lasting 1 hour or less, most athletes do not require dietary sources of energy during the exercise period. However, performance is enhanced during longer endurance or higher-intensity events with the interval consumption of carbohydrates. For high-intensity or endurance exercise lasting more than 1 hour, 30 to 60 g of carbohydrates per hour are recommended. Approximately 1 to 4 g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight is recommended for a pregame meal. Endurance athletes need 7 to 10 g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight per day. For ultra-endurance events longer than 2.5 hours, up to 90 g of carbohydrate per hour may be needed."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The use of stored fat for energy during exercise depends on the level of fitness and the intensity of the exercise; therefore trained endurance athletes are more efficient at using fat for energy than are untrained athletes. Lean body mass influences a person’s fitness level and oxygen use and is efficient in the use of all nutrients. Athletes who cannot meet appropriate energy needs should choose a well-balanced diet with adequate calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients; stored fat is not the first energy source in this situation."

      "explanation": "Energy availability is defined as the amount of dietary energy remaining after subtracting the energy required for exercise training. Various substances that increase work or exercise capacity and output are called ergogenic aids. Millimeters of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body weight per minute as influenced by body composition is referred to as aerobic capacity. Moderate and gradual tapering of exercise while increasing carbohydrate intake is a practice called carbohydrate loading, which occurs the week before an athletic event."

Dehydration of 2% or more of one’s body weight will impair athletic performance, particularly in hot and humid climates. Athletes who are engaged in longer and demanding endurance events (i-e., more than 60 to 90 minutes), especially in a warm environment, may benefit from a sports drink (containing electrolytes and glucose) that has optimal gastric emptying and intestinal absorption times. Continued dehydration is known to cause delirium. Fluid-replacement strategies implemented during exercise may prevent, not worsen, cramps."
