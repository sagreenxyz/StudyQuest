      ],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The statement \"During the incubation period, the virus continues to multiply\" demonstrates understanding of the purpose of antiretroviral therapy. During the incubation period, the virus hides in lymphoid tissues, where it rapidly multiplies as part of its parasitic lifestyle within the host, taking over more of the host’s CD4+T cells and gaining strength. The incubation period is a critical period for early medical treatment and intervention, which includes taking antiretroviral drugs even if the client does not feel ill. The drugs will not cure the client with HIV or stop the HIV virus from multiplying, but they will slow down viral replication. Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think they will recognize the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will seem like the correct response."

      "explanation": "Individuals entering cancer treatment with suboptimal nutrition status have compromised outcomes (e.g., longer hospital stays, increased infection risk, increased mortality). Although increased metabolism may be a side effect of cancer treatment and results in increased nutrient and energy needs, it does not necessarily affect outcomes. Small and frequent feedings may ease gastrointestinal discomfort and do not have an effect on compromised outcomes. Maintaining adequate fluid balance is essential to replace gastrointestinal losses from fever, infection, vomiting, or diarrhea; therefore increased fluid intake would not result in compromised outcomes."

      "explanation": "Initiation is the point at which a mutagen causes irreversible damage to the DNA. There are three phases of carcinogenesis: initiation, promotion, and progression. An agent that prompts the mutated cell to grow and reproduce initiates the promotion phase. Progression is the phase during which the cancer cells advance and become a malignant tumor that is capable of metastasizing. A mutation may disrupt the orderly process of cell division, particularly when the mutation occurs in a regulatory gene, but is not a stage of carcinogenesis."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "HIV’s parasitic nature is evidenced by its replication within the host’s cells. HIV contains two copies of single- stranded RNA, which are copied into DNA. The DNA enters the T-helper cells and begins to control them. HIV can only live through a host that it invades and infects, and the virus hijacks the host’s cell machinery to replicate, making a multitude of copies of themselves. Viruses do not have complex large packets of genetic information; they only contain a small chromosome of nucleic acids (RNA or DNA), usually with fewer than five genes.

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "A pulmonary neoplasm means the client has a new, abnormal cellular growth in the lungs. An overabundance of plasma cells is termed multiple myeloma. A neoplasm is an abnormal process, so the computed tomography scan does show pulmonary disease. Premature babies can be plagued with hyaline membrane disease, which means the baby has immature lung tissue. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

A major function of T cells is to activate phagocytes, which are the cells that destroy invaders and kill disease- carrying antigens. A major function of B cells is to produce antibodies, which also kill antigens. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that contains iron and transports oxygen. Platelets play a role in clotting. Monocytes are phagocytic white blood cells, and erythrocytes are red blood cells. A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell; the two main types are T cells and B cells, but megakaryocytes are large bone marrow cells responsible for the production of platelets."

      "explanation": "A client treated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is at risk for lipoatrophy, which is a reduction in body fat. Lipodystrophy is abnormal fat redistribution associated with metabolic abnormalities and an increased risk for chronic conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance.

      "explanation": "The basic goal of nutritional counseling for the client with HIV is to make the least amount of changes necessary in the person’s lifestyle and food patterns to promote optimal nutritional status while providing maximal comfort and quality of life. Lipodystrophy results from the use of antiretroviral therapy and metabolic changes; diet cannot prevent it. Immediate supplementation is not necessary for every client diagnosed with HIV. Antiretroviral drugs are used to delay the progression of the infection, whereas nutrition is used to support body functions."

This is a period marked by opportunistic illnesses because, at this point, the HIV infection has killed enough host-protective T lymphocytes to severely damage the immune system and lower the body’s normal resistance to disease. Category A is an asymptomatic period during which the client may have mild flu-like symptoms 2 to 4 weeks after infection. Typically, the client feels well for a number of years following this.

A client in category A with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 500 cells/piL or more is not considered to have AIDS. The CD4+ T lymphocyte count is a stage 1 count. The client in category B with a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 200-499 cells/yL is not considered to have AIDS. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs.

Diarrhea is a common side effect of drug-diet interactions and HIV infection. It can lead to the malabsorption of nutrients contributing to wasting. Lack of participation in physical activity (disuse) coupled with systemic inflammation exacerbates muscle wasting. Abnormal metabolism alone will not cause wasting because the elevated resting energy expenditure and decrease in physical activity offset each other. Although it contributes to abnormal body composition of AIDS patients, the causative factor for lipodystrophy is antiretroviral therapy; lipodystrophy is not a process that causes the characteristic body wasting seen in HIV."

This redistribution of fat is associated with metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance. A Mediterranean diet based on vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans, and whole grains, along with daily exercise, is the most effective treatment for this condition. Low-residue diets will not be beneficial to these patients. High protein will assist in muscle maintenance but will not address the needs of a patient with lipodystrophy. A gastrointestinal soft diet does not provide the fiber needed for cardiovascular health beneficial to patients with HIV affected by lipodystrophy."

A client in clinical category B is considered to have AIDS only if the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is in stage 3 (more than 200 cells/uL). A client in category A with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 500 cells/piL or more is not considered to have AIDS. The CD4+ T lymphocyte count is a stage 1 count. The client in category B with a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 200-499 cells/yL is not considered to have AIDS. Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago had seemed completely forgotten."

      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "The client is in stage 0 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system. Stage 0 is defined as an “early HIV infection, inferred from a negative or indeterminate HIV test result within 6 months of a confirmed positive test.\" Clients are categorized as being in stages 1, 2, and 3 based on their CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and symptomatic conditions. Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses."

      "explanation": "Current goals for the medical management of HIV infection include recognizing and treating infection early, preventing opportunistic illness, and boosting the immune system. Prophylactic antibiotics are not used to prevent infection, and high-dose radiation therapy is not used for clients with HIV. Low-dose radiation or anticancer drugs may be used to slow the spread of tumors if they occur during the disease process. Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only some of the options may relate directly to the situation."

      "options": [],
      "correctAnswers": [],
      "explanation": "Many CAM practices have undergone clinical experimentation and failed to produce any positive or cancer- protective results. Experts discourage the use of macrobiotic diets for cancer prevention because of the restrictive nature of the diet and the risk for multiple nutrient deficiencies. Patients often feel uncomfortable discussing their CAM practices with their health care provider, which could result in serious consequences. Clinical experimentation has determined that some CAM practices are not safe in patients with cancer. Dietary supplements can have dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs and reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Test-Taking Tip: Monitor questions that you answer with an educated guess or changed your answer from the first option you selected. This will help you to analyze your ability to think critically. Usually your first answer is correct and should not be changed without reason."

      "correctAnswer": null,
      "explanation": "A client treated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is at risk for lipoatrophy, which is a reduction in body fat. Lipodystrophy is abnormal fat redistribution associated with metabolic abnormalities and an increased risk for chronic conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Lipohypertrophy occurs with the use of protease inhibitors and causes an increase in the fat mass around the abdomen and the back of the neck. Hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by abnormally elevated levels of fats or lipids in the blood."
