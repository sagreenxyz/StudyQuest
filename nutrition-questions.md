Question 1

Which resource provides nurses with the most current scientific and medical research on
nutrition available?

© 2010 Advisory Committee
©) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
© Evidence-based practice

@ ©@ Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL)

That's right!

Rationale

The NEL provides the most current scientific and medical research on nutrition available. The 2010 Advisory
Committee relies on the NEL to make the best recommendations. The FDA is not involved in making
nutritional recommendations, just on the safety of food. Evidence-based practice is the method of providing
reliable and valid research and is not specific to nutrition.

Question 2

Which macronutrient intake is recommended for a healthy diet? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

|_| 30% to 40% of kcal intake from carbohydrates
@ [BB] 45% to 65% of kcal intake from carbohydrates
@ [I] 20% to 35% of kcal intake from fat

|_| 40% to 50% of kcal intake from fat

|_| 20% to 35% of kcal intake from protein

@ |] 10% to 35% of kcal intake from protein

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary reference intake values recommend that 45% to 65% of kcal intake should come from carbohydrates;
20% to 35% of kcal intake should come from fat; and 10% to 35% of kcal intake should come from protein.
For carbohydrates, 30% to 40% is too low. For fat, 40% to 50% is too high. For protein, 20% to 35% is too
high.

p. 4
Question 3

The nurse is caring for an athlete who is participating in a new sport. Which factor will help
the nurse determine the athlete’s energy requirements? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

|_|] Smoking status

@ |B) Sex
@ [Bm] Height
@ [B) Weight
@ (ml Age

[| Food intake

That's right!

Rationale

Sex, height, weight, age, and activity level are factors that determine an athlete’s energy requirements.
Smoking will affect an athlete’s performance but not their energy requirements. Estimating the athlete’s

energy requirements will help determine ideal food intake.

p.7
Question 4

A nurse is preparing an educational program on food labels. On what is the nutritional
information on a food label based?

O National Nutritional Goals

©) Dietary reference intakes

@ © Daily values

© United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)

That's right!

Rationale

The daily values determine information on the food label. The National Nutritional Goals, dietary reference
intakes, and USDA provide other information.

p.7
Question 5

A group of nursing students is learning to work with the MyPlate food guidelines. Which
resource is available on the MyPlate website? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

|_| Serving size based on size of plate
@ |] Sample menus based on sex and age
@ |B) Easy-to-read fact sheets

@ [B] Healthy recipes

[| Location of food sources

That's right!

Rationale
Online, the MyPlate guidelines include resources on sample menus based on sex and age, easy-to-read fact
sheets, and healthy recipes. MyPlate recommends using serving sizes based on food labels. The MyPlate

website does not provide the locations of food sources.

p.8
Question 6

Which menu item does the nurse know fulfills the MyPlate guidelines of 1 oz of grain?

© Two slices of whole grain bread
@ @ A1/2 cup serving of whole grain rice

© wo tortillas (6-inch diameter)

© Two cups of dry cereal

That's right!

Rationale

A 1/2 cup serving of whole grain rice is equal to 1 oz of grain, according to the MyPlate guidelines. One ounce
of grain can be found in one slice of whole grain bread, one 6-in tortilla, and 1 cup of dry cereal.

p.8
Question 7

A patient complains of being tired all the time. After reviewing the patient’s diet, the nurse
hypothesizes that a lack of which nutritional element may be causing the fatigue? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

[| Fried foods
[| Saturated fats

@ [B] Vitamins
@ [B) Minerals
@ [B] Dietary fiber
@ [| Low-fat dairy

So close!

Rationale

Vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and low-fat dairy are foods recommended by the MyPlate guidelines to
increase energy levels. Fried foods and foods high in saturated fats should be limited in order to reduce
fatigue.

p.8
Question 8

Which vitamin nutrient is most important in the promotion of postoperative wound
healing?

O Iron
© Glycogen

ivy) © Vitamin C

© Phosphorus

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin C promotes tissue healing by producing collagen and is therefore most important in the promotion
of postoperative wound healing. Iron is a mineral that contributes to building the oxygen carrier protein
hemoglobin in red blood cells. Glycogen, the main storage form of carbohydrate in the body, is a
polysaccharide. Phosphorus is a mineral involved with calcium building and maintaining bone tissue.

p. 4
Question 9

What is the priority potential risk factor for the patient admitted to the hospital with
uncontrolled chronic hypertension and a blood clot in the left lower leg?

O Overnutrition

©) Food insecurity

O Increased metabolites

ivy) © Drug-nutrient interactions

That's right!

Rationale

The patient admitted with uncontrolled chronic hypertension and a blood clot in the lower left leg will be put
on medication to treat both the cardiac and clotting conditions. Some prescribed medications may interact
with nutrients in food or dietary supplements, thereby creating a drug—nutrient interaction. Overnutrition
results from excess nutrient and/or energy intake over time and the use of excessive amounts of dietary
supplements. Individuals suffering from chronic illness are at an increased risk for food insecurity
independent of their socioeconomic status, which may need to be addressed but is not the priority risk factor.
Metabolites are the product of various reactions as a result of chemical reactions and energy production in the
body; increased metabolites are not the priority risk factor for this patient.

p.2
Question 10

Why is the intake of dietary foods that contain amino acids essential in a patient’s diet?

© The amino acids are the building blocks of lipids.
@ @ The amino acids are required for the synthesis of protein.
© The amino acids influence the absorption of nutrients.

© The primary function of amino acids is to promote tissue building.

That's right!

Rationale

Amino acids are nitrogen-bearing compounds that form the structural units of protein; after digestion, amino
acids are available for synthesis of required proteins. Fatty acids are the building blocks of lipids, which help
build the central fat substance that is necessary in all cell membranes, and promote the transport of fat-
soluble nutrients throughout the body. Dietary fiber helps to regulate the passage of food material through
the gastrointestinal tract and it influences the absorption of nutrients. The primary function of protein is
tissue building.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is the reason.
If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal the
correct answer.

p. 4
Question 11

Which intervention will be the nurse’s priority for a patient newly diagnosed with heart
disease?

© Optimal nutrition

@ ©@ Health promotion
O Preventive health care

©) Monitoring dietary reference intakes (DRIs)

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse will focus on health promotion for the patient newly diagnosed with heart disease. Health
promotion, which includes nutritional intake, is the active engagement in behaviors or programs that advance
positive well-being. Optimal nutrition occurs when a person receives and uses adequate nutrients obtained
from a varied and balanced diet of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and water; this will be
important for the patient, but it is included in health promotion. Preventive health care involves identifying
risk factors in advance that increase a person’s chances of developing a particular health problem; because the
patient already has heart disease, it is too late for this intervention. DRIs are reference values for the nutrient
intake needs of healthy individuals based on sex and age; monitoring them is less important than health
promotion.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p.2
Question 12

What is the correct term for the discipline that applies nutrition science to promote human
health and treat disease?

iv) © Dietetics

© Health promotion

© Gastroenterology

© Proctology

That's right!

Rationale

Dietetics is the health profession responsible for applying nutrition science to promote human health and
treat disease. A registered dietitian is a credentialed nutrition authority who participates on the health care
team. Health promotion is the active engagement in behaviors or programs that advance positive well-being.
Gastroenterology focuses on disorders of the digestive tract and liver; proctology focuses on disorders of the

anus and rectum.

p.1
Question 13

Which food is the most nutrient dense?
iv) © Oranges

O Orange Juice

© Orange sherbet

© Orange soda

That's right!

Rationale

Because oranges are a whole fruit, they have more nutrients and fewer calories than the other foods, making
them the most nutrient dense. Orange juice, sherbet, and soda have fewer nutrients and more sugar and fat,
making them higher in calories and therefore less nutrient dense.

p.9
Question 14

The nurse knows the MyPlate food guidelines are designed to help Americans make better
food choices. On what are these recommendations based? Select all that apply. One, some,
or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

iv) [| Current patterns of consumption

tx} [ml] Nutritional facts

@ [] The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
[|_|] The Food Pyramid
@ |B] Dietary reference intakes (DRIs)

So close!

Rationale

The MyPlate food guidelines are based on current patterns of consumption, the 2020-2025 Dietary
Guidelines, and DRIs. Nutritional facts are a tool used in conjunction with MyPlate. The Food Pyramid is the
previous recommended food guide that MyPlate has replaced.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal

the correct answer.

p.7
Question 15

Which dietary element does the nurse know is included on the MyPlate visual? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
[| Vitamins

@ [By] Fruit

[| Minerals
@ [B) Grains
@ |] Vegetables
@ [B] Protein

That's right!

Rationale

The MyPlate visual includes fruit, grains, vegetables, and protein plus dairy. Vitamins and minerals do not
appear on the visual, but if people adhere to the guidelines, they will increase their intake of vitamins and
minerals.

p.8
Question 16

A nurse is providing nutrition education to a group of parents. Which recommendation will
the nurse make for reducing childhood obesity? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Limit solid fats in the diet.
[| Consume a diet high in trans fats.
@ |B] Consume less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day.

|_| Use partially hydrogenated oils as sources of fat.

@ [BB] Limit added sugars.
|_| Consume 2300 mg of sodium daily.

That's right!

Rationale

Solid fats should be limited, and cholesterol should be limited to less than 300 mg/day. Trans fats and partially
hydrogenated oils should be limited, as should added sugars. Children should be limited to no more than
1500 mg/day of sodium.

p.8
Question 17

The nurse is reviewing a food diary with a patient. Which food should be limited?

@ © Partially hydrogenated oils
O Monounsaturated oils

©) Polyunsaturated oils

© Whole grains

That's right!

Rationale

Partially hydrogenated oils are trans fats and should be limited in the diet. Monounsaturated oils,
polyunsaturated oils, and whole grains are part of a healthy diet, according to MyPlate.

p.9
Question 18

A pregnant woman is concerned about mercury in her diet. Which recommendation does

the nurse make for this patient? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

|_| Consume 4 oz of a variety of seafood per day
@ [By] Limit white tuna intake to 6 oz per week
@ |B] Consume foods with folate
@ [mB] Consume a diet high in vitamin C

@ (BB) Take an iron supplement

|_| Consume swordfish weekly

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse should recommend that the patient limit intake of white tuna to 6 oz per week, consume foods with
folate, consume foods high in vitamin C, and take an iron supplement. These suggestions will keep the
patient’s mercury intake at a minimum while promoting the health of the mother and baby. Consuming 4 oz
of seafood daily would result in too much mercury consumption, as would consuming swordfish weekly.

p.5
Question 19

An overweight child is signing up for after-school programs. Which activity is
recommended to reduce the child’s weight? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Bicycling

@ |B Tennis

@ [mB] Swimming
|_| Newspaper reporting
[| Drama club
[| Speech team

That's right!

Rationale

Physical activity is recommended to reduce overweight and obesity. Bicycling, tennis, and swimming are
physical activities that can reduce overall weight. Newspaper reporting, drama club, and speech team are not
physical activities, although they may help the child’s psychosocial development.

p.2
Question 20

The nurse is helping a patient with newly diagnosed diabetes plan meals. Which food item

does the nurse recommend, especially because it is lowest in calories?

O Saltine crackers

@ ©@ Multigrain cereals

O White bread

© Apple crisp

That's right!

Rationale
Multigrain cereals are lower-calorie, nutrient-dense foods compared with refined grains high in sugar and fat,

such as saltine crackers, white bread, and apple crisp.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid spending excessive time on any one question. Most questions can be answered in 1 to

2 minutes.

p.8
Question 21

A patient with a familial history of heart disease and diabetes asks the nurse, "How can |
prevent these diseases from happening to me?" Which is the most comprehensive resource
for this patient?

© MyPlate

@ ©@ Healthy People 2030
O National Health Goals

© Recommended dietary allowances (RDAs)

That's right!

Rationale

Healthy People 2030 focuses on health promotion and disease prevention, so this is the best resource for a
patient who wants to avoid heart disease and diabetes. MyPlate is a public educational tool focused only on
nutrition. The National Health Goals reflect a wellness philosophy based on holistic health and health
promotion and are less focused on disease prevention. RDAs provide the average daily dietary intake level that
is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all healthy individuals in a group; they are not focused
on disease prevention.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for grammatical inconsistencies. If the response is intended to complete the stem (an
incomplete sentence) but makes no grammatical sense to you, it might be a distractor rather than the correct
response. Question writers typically try to eliminate these inconsistencies.

pp. 1-2
Question 22

A patient learning to use MyPlate states, "| don’t know how to prepare some of the food that

is recommended." What is the nurse’s best response?

@ @ “Let me call the registered dietitian."
© "The Internet has a lot of recipes available."
© "There are sample menus on the MyPlate website."

© "Your local library has cookbooks you can check out."

That's right!

Rationale

The registered dietitian is the nutrition authority on the health care team and carries the major responsibility
of nutrition care for patients. They can assess the patient’s ability to prepare food and assist them by providing
appropriate recipes. Searching the Internet for recipes may not yield healthy results if the patient does not
know what to look for. Sample menus will not help the patient prepare the foods; the menu provides examples
for daily meals, not actual recipes. Like the Internet, library cookbooks do not necessarily have healthy recipes.

p.1
Question 23

Which provides an essential base for all metabolic processes?

iv) © Water
O Protein

© Glycogen
© Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale

Water provides an essential base for all metabolic processes. Some of the roles for which protein is responsible
include structure, enzyme and hormone production, and fluid balance. Glycogen is the main storage form of
carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide the body’s primary and preferred source of fuel for energy.

p.4
Question 24

Which patient is at highest risk for harmful overnutrition?

© The patient who consumes alcohol
@ ©@ The patient who takes multiple vitamin supplements
© The patient who consumes a diet high in saturated fat

© The patient who has a suboptimal intake of fruits and vegetables

That's right!

Rationale

The patient taking multiple vitamin supplements is at greatest risk for harmful overnutrition. The overuse of
supplements can lead to vitamin or mineral toxicity. The patient who consumes a diet high in saturated fat,
alcohol, or who has a suboptimal intake of fruits and vegetables has made poor dietary choices and may
experience suboptimal nutritional intake.

p. 6
Question 25

How many kilocalories are consumed when eating 16 g of fat? Record your answer using a

whole number. rv) kcal

That's right!

Rationale

There are 9 kcal in each gram of fat. To determine the amount of kcal in 16 g of fat, 9 kcal is multiplied by 16
g. There are 144 kcal in 16 g of fat.

p.3
Question 26

Which statement best describes the role of nutrients?

© Nutrients are units of heat measure.
@ ©@ Nutrients have specific metabolic functions.
© Nutrients accomplish basic life-sustaining tasks.

© Nutrients work individually to maintain bodily processes.

That's right!

Rationale

Individual nutrients have specific metabolic functions, including primary and secondary roles. Human energy
is measured in heat units called kilocalories. Metabolism refers to the sum of all body processes that
accomplish the basic life-sustaining tasks. No nutrient ever works alone.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer, pattern, or code. There may be times when four or five
consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p.3
Question 27

In which category of the daily recommended intake (DRI) interconnected categories will the
patient fall if a diet that is 35% fat is consumed?

©) Adequate intake
@ ©@ Tolerable upper intake level

O Estimated average requirement

© Recommended dietary allowance (RDA)

That's right!

Rationale

The patient who has a dietary intake of 35% fat falls in the "tolerable upper intake level" category, which is not
recommended. Adequate intake is used as a guide when insufficient scientific evidence is available to establish
an RDA. The estimated average requirement is the intake level that meets the needs of half of the individuals
in specific groups. The RDA is the average daily dietary intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient
requirements of nearly all healthy individuals in a group.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

pp. 3, 6
Question 28

An older woman is asking which special nutrient she should consume as she ages. Which
nutrient or food is important to include in her menu plan?

© Synthetic folic acid
©) Low-fat proteins

ivy) © Foods fortified with vitamin B 3
© Low-fat milks

That's right!

Rationale

Older adults should consume foods fortified with vitamin B 19, like fortified cereals and dietary supplements.
Synthetic folic acid is recommended for women capable of becoming pregnant. Low-fat proteins and low-fat
milks are recommended for all ages.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real
intent of the question.

p. 6
Question 29

The nurse is assessing the diet of a family who is having trouble adhering to the MyPlate
food guidelines. Which factor most limits their food choices?

© The father has two jobs to meet the family’s financial needs.
© The family receives food stamps for all six people.
© The family has a car and can drive to the grocery store.

@ @ The family makes monthly trips to the food pantry.

That's right!

Rationale

Food pantries have foods to feed people in need but may be limited on choices, especially for people with
allergies and special dietary needs. This can limit healthy food choices. Working two jobs to meet financial

needs, access to food stamps, and a car for trips to the grocery store help allow for better choices.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p.2
Question 30

An athlete wants to improve performance by consuming more protein. Which food does the

nurse recommend removing?

iv) © Pancakes

O Northern beans
O Almonds

O Eggs

That's right!

Rationale
Pancakes are not a significant source of protein, so the nurse will recommend removing these. Northern

beans, almonds, and eggs are excellent sources of protein.

Test-Taking Tip: Reread the question if the answers do not seem to make sense because you may have missed

words such as not or except in the statement.

p.8
Question 31

A patient consumes large amounts of fruits but no vegetables. Which nutrient might the

nurse expect to be low in the patient’s laboratory test results?

O Vitamin C

O Folate
ivy) © Vitamin K

O Potassium

That's right!

Rationale
Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables but not fruits, so the patient may have low vitamin K levels.

Vitamin C, folate, and potassium are nutrients found in fruits.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p.8
Question 32

The nurse is helping a new mother plan menus for her growing family. Which
recommendation most facilitates adding variety to the family’s diet?

@ @ Eating foods from all food groups and subgroups
© Eating more fruits and vegetables and fewer foods with added sugars
© Limiting foods that contain saturated and trans fats

© Being physically active every day

That's right!

Rationale

Variety in the diet is facilitated by eating foods from all food groups and subgroups. Adding more fruits and
vegetables in correct portions, limiting sugars and fats, and performing daily physical activity are
recommended but do not necessarily add variety to the diet.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p.7
Question 33

Which statement provides the rationale for the creation of the dietary reference intakes
(DRIs) guideline?

© The recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) guidelines were outdated.
© Areliable way to assess nutrient deficiencies was needed.
© There was a desire to document the average dietary requirement for each nutrient.

@ @ Public awareness shifted from deficiency prevention to maintaining optimal health.

That's right!

Rationale

Public awareness and research attention have shifted from the original goal of preventing deficiency disease to
reflect an increasing emphasis on nutrient requirements for maintaining optimal health. This change of
emphasis resulted in the DRIs project. Since 1941, the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) have been
the authoritative source for setting standards for the minimum amounts of nutrients necessary to protect
almost all people against the risk for nutrient deficiency and this remains true today. The Estimated Average
Requirement guidelines already exist and provide the mean, or average, dietary requirement of a nutrient ina
specific population group. Test-Taking Tip: Do not panic while taking an exam! Panic will only increase your
anxiety. Stop for a moment, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and resume review of the question.

p. 6
Question 34

Which is a recommendation from "Choose MyPlate’s 10 Tips to a Great Plate"?
© Switch to fat-free or 2% milk.

© Compare iron content in foods.
@ @ Make half your grains whole grains.
© Drink diet drinks instead of sugary drinks.

That's right!

Rationale

"Choose MyPlate’s 10 Tips to a Great Plate" includes making half of the grains consumed whole grains. The
tips recommend switching to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk, comparing sodium content in foods, and drinking
water instead of sugary drinks.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly
answering each question.

p.8
Question 35

To sustain life, the nutrients in food must perform which function in the body? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Build tissue

[| Build bones

@ |B] Provide energy

[| Prevent infection

@ [B] Regulate metabolic processes

That's right!

Rationale

To sustain life, the nutrients in foods must perform three basic functions within the body: build tissue, provide
energy, and regulate metabolic processes. Prevention of infection and the building of bones are
supplemented by food nutrients but are not direct products of them.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p.3
Question 36

Which piece of information does the MyPlate food guidelines use to create a personalized
food plan? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [| “ze
@ [Bm] Height
@ |B) Sex
@ [B) Weight
[| Income

|_| Geographic location

That's right!

Rationale

Participants can personalize their own food plan by accessing the website and entering their age, height, sex,
weight, and activity level. Income and geographic location are not parts of the MyPlate personalized food plan
but may have an impact on overall nutrition.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are being
asked to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but
only some of the may options relate directly to the situation.

p.8
Question 37

Which resource is best used for determining optimal carbohydrate consumption for a
healthy young adult?

© Healthy People 2030
@ © Dietary reference intakes (DRIs)
©) Dietary Guidelines for Americans

©) Recommended dietary allowance (RDAs)

That's right!

Rationale

DRis are reference values for the nutrient intake needs of healthy individuals based on sex and age. The
Healthy People 2030 objective focuses on health promotion and disease prevention. The Dietary Guidelines for
Americans is an overall guide for promoting dietary and lifestyle choices that reduce the risk for chronic
disease. RDAs are the average daily dietary intake levels that are sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of
nearly all healthy individuals in a group.

p.7
Question 38

Which nutrient breaks down to yield energy within the body? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Fats

@ [B) Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale
Of the six essential nutrients, the three energy-yielding nutrients are fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Water,

vitamins, and minerals are essential nutrients that do not provide energy.

p.3
Question 39

What percentage of total kilocalories is the maximum recommended intake of protein as

part of a whole diet?
OC 25%
@ @ 35%

That's right!

Rationale

The recommended intake of protein as a percentage of total kilocalories of the whole diet is 35%. The overall
recommendation for protein ranges from 10% to 35% of the whole diet; 25% is lower than the maximum.
The percentage 45% is too high, and 15% is too low.

p. 4
Question 40

Which household has the highest risk for food insecurity?
@ ©@ A household with children

© Asingle-income household
© A household with an elderly couple

© A household in which the head is experiencing chronic illness

That's right!

Rationale

Households with children report almost double the rate of food insecurity as households without children. A
single-income household is not necessarily at risk for food insecurity. A household with an elderly couple is at
risk for food insecurity when low socioeconomic status, disability, and/or chronic disease are present. If the
head of a household is experiencing chronic disease, the household may be at risk for food insecurity but not

as much as a household with children.

p.5
Question 41

Which dietary reference intake (DRI) panel was developed by the Food and Nutrition Board
of the Institute of Medicine to examine the benefits of nutrition and the hazards of
consuming too much of a nutrient? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may
be correct.

|_| Fatty acids
@ [B] Antioxidants
© [BE] Micronutrients
@ [BB] Trace elements

iv) [ml] Folate and other B vitamins

So close!

Rationale

Six DRI panels were developed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to examine the
benefits of nutrition and the hazards of consuming too much of a nutrient. These include antioxidants, trace
elements, and folate and other B vitamins. DRI panels were not developed for fatty acids and micronutrients.

p. 6
Question 42

When using MyPlate, participants are provided a recommendation of serving amounts
from each food group. What other information can an individual expect in the
recommendation?

© Ideal weight
© Exercise plan

ivy) © Calorie intake

© Ideal body mass index (BMI)

That's right!

Rationale

The MyPlate food guidelines create a plan with individualized calorie levels. The site also offers participants
worksheets, resources, and individualized tools, such as trackers for food, physical activity, and weight.
MyPlate does not provide an ideal weight, exercise plan, or ideal BMI.

p.8
Question 43

Which specific national goal of the Healthy People 2030 initiative is listed under the
Nutrition and Healthy Eating category? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses
may be correct.

|_| Reducing poverty
@ |B] Promoting access to healthier food

iv) [ml] Increasing iron intake

[_] Increasing folate intake

@ [B] !mproving nutrition in health care settings

That's right!

Rationale

Some of the specific national goals of Healthy People 2030 under the Nutrition and Healthy Eating category
include promoting access to healthier food, reducing iron deficiency, and improving nutrition in health care

Question 44

What major theme is identified in the most recent major report in the Healthy People
series? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [Bm] Weight control

@ [B] Healthy choices in diet
tx} [ml] Reduction of alcohol intake
iv) [ml] Education about risk factors for disease

|_| Education about drug-nutrient interactions

So close!

Rationale

The major themes of the most recent Healthy People report include promotion of weight control,
encouragement of healthy diet choices, and education about disease risk factors. Reduction of alcohol

consumption and drug—nutrient interactions are not major themes of this report.

Question 45

Which is an example of a nutrition intervention recommended in the Healthy People 2030
national goal for Nutrition and Healthy Eating?

© An improved school lunch menu
@ @ Greater variety in healthy options on the workplace food menu
© Increased physical activity in school

© Added vitamins to the nation’s food supply

That's right!

Rationale

One nutrition intervention recommended in the Healthy People 2030 national goal for nutrition and weight
status is improved nutrition in the workplace. Improved school lunch menus, increased physical activity in
school, and adding vitamins to the nation’s food supply are not specifically identified as recommended

interventions under Nutrition and Healthy Eating.

Question 46

After reviewing "Choose MyPlate’s 10 Tips to a Great Plate," a patient tells the nurse, "| do
not like milk, but | know | need calcium. Can | substitute ice cream for milk?" What is the
nurse’s most appropriate response?

@ @ “Let's explore some other dietary options."
© "Increase your intake of dark leafy vegetables."
© "You most certainly can; you need the calcium."

© "You should increase the amount of cheese in your diet."

That's right!

Rationale

The most appropriate response by the nurse is "Let’s explore some other dietary options." This will provide the
nurse the opportunity to better assess the patient’s diet and make more appropriate recommendations than
ice cream for the patient. Increasing the intake of some dark green leafy vegetables will help provide the
patient with added calcium, but calcium from these sources is not as easily absorbed in the body compared
with other dietary sources. Encouraging the patient to eat ice cream will add unnecessary fat, added sugar,
and added salt in the diet. Cheese is an excellent source of calcium but also high in fat. The patient should be
educated on the varied sources of calcium in order to make the best dietary choices.

Question 47

According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which type of fat should be limited in the
diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Trans fats
iv) [ml] Saturated fats

@ [B] Hydrogenated fats
[_] Polyunsaturated fats

[| Monounsaturated fats

That's right!

Rationale
Trans, saturated, and hydrogenated fats should be limited in the diet. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated

fats can be included in healthy diets.

p.9
Question 48

What is the nurse’s best approach to educating a patient who wants to start a popular
weight-loss diet?
@ @ Review the diet.

©) Support the patient’s decision.

© Provide a meal plan for the patient.

© Encourage the diet in addition to increased physical activity.

That's right!

Rationale

Providing a patient-centered approach, the nurse should review the popular weight-loss diet to ensure that
the general dietary needs are still being met in accordance with the dietary reference intake recommendations
before supporting the patient’s decision. Dismissing a dietary preference in favor of a meal plan may promote
patient resistance. Encouraging the diet in addition to increased physical activity before review of the diet is
not a safe practice.

Question 49

Dietary recommendations from various organizations, such as the American Cancer Society
and American Heart Association, are modeled after what?

© MyPlate
© Healthy People 2030

©) Dietary reference intakes (DRIs)
@ ©@ Dietary Guidelines for Americans

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary recommendations from various organizations are modeled after the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
MyPlate is a food guidance system created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide the public with a
nutrition education tool. Healthy People 2030 focuses on health promotion and disease prevention. The DRIs
are reference values for the nutrient needs of healthy individuals based on sex and age.

Question 51

The nurse is providing nutrition education to a patient with high blood pressure. Which

nutrient will the nurse recommend to offset sodium intake?

© Calcium
© Vitamin D
© Fiber

@ ©@ Potassium

That's right!

Rationale
Potassium is essential and is often lacking in the diet; it should be consumed to offset sodium intake to help
control blood pressure. Calcium, vitamin D, and fiber are necessary and often also lacking in the American

diet, but they do not affect sodium intake.

p.9
Question 52

The nurse is helping an overweight adult with menu options. Which fats should be limited
to less than 10% of overall kilocalories consumed?

iv) © Saturated fats

O Monounsaturated fats

©) Polyunsaturated fats

O Alcohol

That's right!

Rationale

Saturated fats should be limited to less than 10% of overall kilocalories consumed and replaced with
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Alcohol is not a fat.

p.3
Question 53

The nurse is educating a community group on what color vegetables to include in the diet.
Which should the nurse include? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

@ |n| Red

That's right!

Rationale
The nurse will recommend red, dark green, and orange vegetables. Blue and pink colors may be found in

fruits but not in vegetables.

p.8
Question 54

The nurse is discussing folate with a pregnant patient. What will the nurse tell her?

@ ©@ Folic acid is a synthetic supplement.
©) Folate is not found naturally in foods.
©) Folate is not required while pregnant.

©) Folate is dangerous to consume while pregnant.

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse will explain that folic acid is a synthetic supplement. Folate is naturally found in foods and is
required for pregnant women. It is not dangerous; rather, it supports a healthy pregnancy.

p. 6
Question 55

Which are the preferred reference values for evaluating diets in healthy people?

© Adequate intakes
© Tolerable upper intake levels
@ ©@ Dietary reference intakes

© Recommended dietary allowances

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary reference intakes are the preferred reference values for evaluating diets in healthy people. Adequate
intake is the suggested daily intake of a nutrient to support health. Tolerable upper intake level is the
maximum daily intake of a nutrient unlikely to cause adverse effects. Recommended dietary allowance is the
average daily intake of a nutrient that meets the requirements of nearly all healthy people.

p. 6
Question 56

Who establishes the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs)?

© An experienced dietitian
© A group of dietitians
© A doctor of nutrition

@ ©@ An expert panel of nutrition scientists

That's right!

Rationale
RDAs are established and updated by an expert panel of nutrition scientists, which may include experienced

dietitians and doctors of nutrition.

p. 6
Question 57

The nurse is evaluating the supplements a patient reports taking. What resource will aid in

the nurse’s assessment?
©) Adequate intake

@ ©@ Tolerable upper intake level
©) Dietary reference intake

© Recommended dietary allowance

That's right!

Rationale

Tolerable upper intake level is the maximum daily intake of a nutrient unlikely to cause adverse effects. This is
valuable information for the nurse to know when evaluating a patient’s supplement intake. Adequate intake is
the suggested daily intake of nutrient to support health. Dietary reference intakes are the reference values for
evaluating diets in healthy people. Recommended dietary allowance is the average daily intake of a nutrient

that meets the requirements of nearly all healthy people.

Question 58

The nurse is helping a group of patients understand changes with aging. At what age do
nutrient requirements change?

O 40 years

iv) © 50 years

O 60 years

O 65 years

That's right!

Rationale

Nutrient requirements change at age 50 years. There are two categories for requirement of nutrients, one for
under the age of 50 and one for over the age of 50.

p.8
Question 59

Which resource provides nurses with the most current scientific and medical research on
nutrition available?

© 2010 Advisory Committee
©) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
© Evidence-based practice

@ ©@ Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL)

That's right!

Rationale

The NEL provides the most current scientific and medical research on nutrition available. The 2010 Advisory
Committee relies on the NEL to make the best recommendations. The FDA is not involved in making
nutritional recommendations, just on the safety of food. Evidence-based practice is the method of providing
reliable and valid research and is not specific to nutrition.

Question 60

Which macronutrient intake is recommended for a healthy diet? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

|_| 30% to 40% of kcal intake from carbohydrates
@ [BB] 45% to 65% of kcal intake from carbohydrates
@ [I] 20% to 35% of kcal intake from fat

|_| 40% to 50% of kcal intake from fat

|_| 20% to 35% of kcal intake from protein

@ |] 10% to 35% of kcal intake from protein

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary reference intake values recommend that 45% to 65% of kcal intake should come from carbohydrates;
20% to 35% of kcal intake should come from fat; and 10% to 35% of kcal intake should come from protein.
For carbohydrates, 30% to 40% is too low. For fat, 40% to 50% is too high. For protein, 20% to 35% is too
high.

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
@ [By Vitamin

@ [By Vitaminc

Vitamin E

Vitamin K

@ [By Vitamin B complex

Question 2

Which range represents the number of times per day a breastfed infant should feed?

© © Fourto six
© Upto 10
© Atleast 12

@ © Unlimited

So close!

Rationale

No restrictions should be placed on the number of times an infant, particularly a newborn, nurses per day, in
part because of the supply-and-demand nature of breastfeeding. The infant should not be restricted to four to
six or up to 10 feedings per day, nor should the infant be forced to feed at least 12 times per day.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five
consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

Question 4

Which food is a good source for DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

@ I Ege yolks and algae

Milk, yogurt, and other dairy products
@ [By Fish and seafood

© I Liver, legumes, and green leafy vegetables

Yellow vegetables and fruits

So close!

Rationale

Egg yolks and algae as well as fish and seafood are rich in DHA. Milk, yogurt, and other dairy products are
good sources of calcium, not DHA. Liver, legumes, and green leafy vegetables are good sources of iron, not
DHA. Vitamin A, not DHA, is provided by yellow vegetables and fruits.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 156
Question 5

Why is human milk the ideal first food for human infants?

CO It contains high levels of iron and vitamin D.
@ ©@ Its nutrient content regularly changes to meet the infant's needs.
CO Itis low in fat and sugar, which establishes early healthy eating habits.

CO tis nearly identical in nutrient content to cow's milk, making the transition to cow’s milk smoother.

That's right!

Rationale

Human milk changes to meet changing nutrient and energy needs of the newborn and the maturing infant
during the first months of life. It is always there in the correct form to meet the growing infant's needs.
Human milk may not provide sufficient levels of iron and vitamin D after 6 months. The macronutrient
content of human milk changes to meet the infant’s needs, but it is not considered a low-fat or low-sugar
food. The nutrient contents of human milk and cow’s milk vary considerably.

Question 6

Which statement regarding treatment for a pregnant client with severe nausea and
vomiting is untrue?

© "You may find ginger and B ¢ supplements helpful in decreasing nausea.”
@ © "Make sure to always drink liquids with your meals to help with digestion."
© © "Snacks and meals should be fairly dry and bland and low in fat and fiber."

© "Try to always keep some food in your stomach by eating small, frequent meals."

So close!

Rationale

Pregnant clients suffering from nausea and vomiting should be encouraged to drink liquids between meals,
not with meals; thus this statement requires correction. Ginger and B g supplements can help decrease
nausea. Dry, bland, low-fat, and low-fiber meals and snacks are recommended to combat nausea and
vomiting. Small, frequent meals and snacks to prevent an empty stomach can help with nausea and vomiting.

p. 161
Question 7

The nursing student is learning about what a mother experiences while lactating. Which
statement by the student requires correction by the instructor?

@ © “Atingling sensation in the breast may indicate mastitis or a plugged duct."
© "Colostrum may be secreted from the breast during late pregnancy."
© "During pregnancy, estrogen stimulates proliferation of the ductal system."

© “Oxytocin is involved in stimulating both uterine contractions and milk ejection."

That's right!

Rationale

Many women experience a tingling sensation in the breast when let-down of milk occurs. This sensation is

normal and is not a sign of mastitis, plugged duct, or other complications. It is true that colostrum may be
secreted from the breast during late pregnancy, estrogen stimulates proliferation of the ductal system, and

oxytocin is involved in stimulating both uterine contractions and milk ejection.

P. 169
Question 8

If a woman's pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 26.5, which range of total
pregnancy weight gain in pounds would be recommended to this client?

O l1to20
@ @ 15t025
© 25 to 35

© 28 to 40

That's right!

Rationale

ABMI of 26.5 places the client in the overweight category, so the total recommended weight gain is 15 to 25
Ib. A total weight gain of 11 to 20 Ib is recommended for a woman categorized as obese by BMI. A total weight
gain of 25 to 35 Ib is recommended for a woman categorized as normal weight by BMI. A total weight gain of
28 to 40 |b is recommended for a woman categorized as underweight by BMI.

p. 161
Question 9

For which complication are clients at higher risk if they did not gain adequate weight
during pregnancy?

© Anencephaly

O© Malformed facial features

CO Inadequate fetal bone growth
@ © Small-for-gestational-age infant

That's right!

Rationale

Patients who are underweight (body mass index [BMI] less than 18.5) at the start of pregnancy should have a
total weight gain between 28 and 40 Ib. Low maternal weight gain is a predictor of small-for-gestational-age
infants. Anencephaly can result from folate deficiency, not low weight gain. Malformed facial features can
result from alcohol use, not low weight gain, during pregnancy. Inadequate fetal bone growth may result from
lack of vitamin D, not low weight gain during pregnancy.

Question 11

Which statement by the nurse concerning the maternal need for increased kilocalories
during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy requires clarification?

© "The metabolic workload of the fetus requires increased fuel."

© ‘Added tissue-building requirements need more kilocalories to spare protein."
© © “More kilocalories are needed to supply increased fuel for the mother’s metabolic workload.”

@ O "Kilocalorie needs during the second and third trimesters do not vary significantly from the first."

So close!

Rationale

More kilocalories are necessary during the second and third trimesters compared with the first trimester,
when the kilocalorie needs are the same as they were before conception. The increased kilocalories are needed
to support the increased demands of the metabolic workload of the fetus, added tissue-building
requirements, and the increased metabolic workload of the mother.

Question 12

Which statement shows an understanding of foods that are good sources of complete
protein foods?

@ ©@ "ican get complete proteins from foods like eggs, milk, and beef"
© "Beans, peas, and lentils are all great sources of complete proteins."
© "Good sources of complete proteins are items from the grains group."

© "Nuts would be a good snack to help provide a source of complete proteins.”

That's right!

Rationale

Complete proteins can be found in eggs, milk, and beef. Legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils; grains; and
nuts are all sources of incomplete proteins, not complete proteins.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

Question 14

Which factor is most likely to present challenges to breastfeeding? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [By] Maternal fatigue and stress

Smaller than average breast size

@ |B) Moderate consumption of alcohol

@ [BM A diet consisting of 1600 kcal/day

Failure to increase vitamin D above pregnancy levels

That's right!

Rationale

Maternal fatigue and stress may present a challenge to breastfeeding by inhibiting the let-down reflex. Even
moderate consumption of alcohol may also inhibit the let-down reflex. A diet consisting of 1600 kcal/day is
below the recommended minimum energy intake to sustain adequate lactation. Breast size is not a
determinant of successful breastfeeding. The dietary reference intake for vitamin D is the same for lactating
and pregnant women.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

Drink plenty of liquids throughout the day to maintain proper hydration.

Rest when the baby sleeps to prevent fatigue.

Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation.

Establish a routine for both mom and baby.

That's right!

Rationale

Patients may have a difficult time with lactation because of nutrition and hydration issues, rest, exercise, and
relaxation. There are also prolactin inhibitors such as stress, fatigue, medical complications, lack of support,
poor self-efficiency, and irregular breastfeeding schedule that can affect lactation. Therefore the nurse would
provide information on ways to reduce the risk for developing these inhibitors such as drinking plenty of
liquids, resting when baby rests, practicing meditation or other stress-relieving exercises, and establishing a
routine for both mom and baby. The fat stored from pregnancy is needed for the extra energy supply needed
during lactation.

Question 25

Which factor accounts for the increased caloric needs of lactating mothers? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

il] The energy content of milk

| The metabolic work of milk production

The energy expenditure of the active mother

Maintenance of maternal adipose tissue storage

The decreased metabolic rate of the postpartum mother

So close!

Rationale

The recommended calo

\crease is 330 kcal/day (plus 170 kcal/day from maternal stores) in the first 6
months and 400 kcal/day in the second 6 months of breastfeeding (beyond the usual adult allowance). This
additional energy need for the overall total lactation process is based on four factors: the energy content of
milk, the metabolic work of milk production, the energy expenditure of the active mother, and maintenance of
maternal adipose tissue storage. The metabolic rate of the postpartum, lactating mother is increased, not
decreased.

Question 26

When using the Daily Food Plan for Moms to determine nutrition needs for lactating
mothers, which factor is taken into consideration? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

| Infant's age

Presence of prolactin inhibitors

‘Amount of fat stored during pregnancy

‘Amount of breast milk the mom is producing

Mother's age, height, weight, and physical activity level

So close!

Rationale

The Daily Food Plan for Moms takes into consideration the age of the infant who is being breastfed. The
amount of breast milk that the mom is producing is one of the factors taken into consideration when using
the Daily Food Plan for Moms to offer individualized recommendations for lactating mothers. The mother’s
age, height, weight, and physical activity level are used to evaluate her nutrition needs using the Daily Food
Plan for Moms. The presence of prolactin inhibitors is a factor that may contribute to early cessation of
breastfeeding; t
the mother during pregnancy helps meet some of the extra energy needs when breastfeeding, but this is not a

is not taken into account when using the Daily Food Plan for Moms. The extra fat stored in

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

i] Preterm birth

Bm) Preeclampsia

Gestational diabetes

i] Low-birth-weight infant

Increased risk of cesarean delivery

So close!

Rationale

A deficiency in vitamin D during pregnancy can result in preterm birth, preeclampsia, and gestational
diabetes. Inappropriate weight gain, not vitamin D deficiency, may result in a low-birth-weight infant and
increased risk of cesarean delivery.

Question 28

Which reason is associated with increased protein needs during pregnancy? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Il] Development of the placenta

| Growth of maternal tissues

Increased maternal blood volume

Amniotic fluid

| Growth of the fetus

So close!

Rationale

During pregnancy, the development of the placenta requires sufficient protein to sustain, support, and
nourish the fetus. Increased protei

is required for the development of uterine and breast tissue to support
pregnancy and lactation. Hemoglobin, albumin, and other blood components vital to pregnancy require
increased protein as the mother’s plasma volume increases. Amniotic fluid contains various proteins, and the
need for protein increases as the pregnancy progresses. There is a relatively large amount of protein needed
for the rapid growth of the fetus during pregnancy.

Question 29

Which would be critical to discuss with the health care team of a pregnant patient with a
history of eating disorders to include in the plan of care to support a successful outcome?
Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [By Postpartum care

Breastfeeding to support weight loss after delivery

@ [BM] Emphasis on nutritional needs of the growing fetus

@ [Bf Anticipated maternal body size and shape changes

The need to prioritize the baby over oneself

That's right!

Rationale

For individuals with bulimia nervosa who are pregnant, the health care team should focus on postpartum

care, emphasize nutritional needs of the growing fetus, and discuss anticipated maternal body size and shape
changes to best support a successful pregnancy outcome. Breastfeeding should not be discussed in terms of
its possible role in helping keep weight down, nor should the patient be told not to focus on herself
throughout the pregnancy because the health of both mother and baby are important.

Question 30

For which nutrient is the dietary reference intakes (DRIs) increased during pregnancy?
Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Fluoride

Zinc

Niacin

B| Calcium

So close!

Rationale

The DRls recommend increased zinc and niacin during pregnancy, but intake of vitamin D, fluoride, and
calcium can remain the same.

Question 31

Which growth need during pregnancy requires sufficient protein? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Amniotic fluid

| Growth of the fetus

Il] Development of the placenta

i] Increased synthesis of hemoglobin and albumin

‘Absorption and use of calcium for fetal bone growth

So close!

Rationale

Sufficient protein is needed to support amniotic fluid, rapid growth of the fetus, development of a mature
placenta to support the fetus, and increased synthesis of hemoglobin and albumin secondary to the increased
maternal blood volume required to nourish the fetus and support increased metabolic demands. Vitamin D,
not protein, is necessary for supporting absorption and the use of calcium to support fetal bone growth.

p. 156
Question 32

When supplementing infant feedings with breast milk substitutes or formula, which
complication may result?

© The infant may become dehydrated.

CO The infant may not receive enough calories.

© The mammary glands may revert to producing colostrum.

@ @ The mammary glands may produce less milk in response to fewer infant feedings.

That's right!

Rationale

each time that the infant feeds. Therefore the more milk that is taken from the breast, the more milk the
mother produces. If the infant requires supplemental feedings, the mammary glands may in turn produce
less milk. If caregivers follow formula preparation and feeding instructions properly, the infant should not
become dehydrated or receive too few calories. The mammary glands are not at risk of reverting to the
production of colostrum.

Question 33

Breastfeeding provides which benefit for the lactating mother? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Improved bone density

Decreased postpartum bleeding

Earlier return of the menstrual cycle

ll] Earlier return to prepregnancy weight

li) Decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancers

So close!

Rationale

Benefits of breastfeeding for the lactating mother include improved bone density, decreased postpartum
bleeding, earlier return to prepregnancy weight, and decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancers.
Breastfeeding mothers may experience delayed, not earlier, return of the menstrual cycle.

p.171
Question 34

At which time do levels of oxytocin increase? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [| After delivery of the baby

@ [By] When the infant suckles at the breast

During weaning

When the colostrum transitions to milk

@ [Bi Before the onset of labor

So close!

Rationale

Oxytocin increases after delivery of the baby (not before the onset of labor) and when the infant suckles at the
breast. It may also increase when a breastfeeding mother hears any infant cry, which may stimulate the let-
down reflex. Oxytocin does not increase during weaning or when the colostrum transitions to milk.

p. 168
Question 35

Which factor is a prolactin inhibitor leading to the early cessation of breastfeeding? Select
all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Stress

i] Fatigue

li] Medical complications

Lack of support

Poor self-efficacy

i] Irregular breastfeeding

So close!

Rationale

Psychologic factors like stress may lead to early cessation of breastfeeding. Fatigue is a factor that is a prolactin
inhibitor leading to early cessation of breastfeeding. Medical complications are a contributing factor to early
cessation of breastfeeding. Lack of support from family or friends is a prolactin inhibitor, which may lead to
the early cessation of breastfeeding. Poor self-efficacy is a negative psychologic factor that may lead to early

cessation of breastfeeding. Irregular breastfeeding is a prolactin inhibitor leading to the early cessation of
breastfeeding.

p.171
Question 36

Which pregnant patient would have the highest nutritional risk for pregnancy
complications?
@ @ 4 40-year-old patient of low socioeconomic status with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5
© Asingle 18-year-old patient with a BMI of 20.5
© A 30-year-old patient with a BMI of 22 who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day

© A 24-year-old patient with a BMI of 21 who maintains a vegetarian diet

That's right!

Rationale

Age over 35, BMI below 18.5, and low socioeconomic status at the onset of pregnancy may lead to pregnancy
complications, placing the 40-year-old patient at the highest risk. The 18-year-old patient with a BMI of 20.5
and single status does not have any indicated nutritional risk factors. The 30-year-old patient with a BMI of
22 who smokes has one risk factor: smoking. The 24-year-old patient with a BMI of 21 who is a vegetarian has
no risk factors.

Question 37
ey

When assessing an adolescent pregnant patient, on which area of concern would the nurse
focus to develop a prenatal plan of care? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses
may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Accessibility to prenatal care

ll] Family history of low-birth-weight births

Social behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption

Patient's feeling about the pregnancy and health status

| Socioeconomic status and needs

So close!

Rationale

‘Adolescent pregnancies are more likely to have pregnancy complications and poor outcomes such as infant
mortality, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. Adolescents are also likely to have many emotional and
nutritional risks. Therefore the nurse would concentrate on the patient's accessibility to the health care
provider for prenatal care and socioeconomic status, which would address support, care, and nutritional

n

needs. Also, determining social behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, will help develop a plan

to stop these behaviors to prevent low birth weight and infant mortality. Determining how the patient feels

about the pregnancy and health status will guide the nurse in determining psychosocial needs. Family history

of low-birth-weight births is not directly correlated to the patient's risk for problems related to pregnancy and
birth.

p. 162
Question 38

Which intervention would be implemented for a pregnant patient with a prior history of
hyperemesis gravidarum to prevent hospitalization? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

© [BM] Educate the patient on avoiding smells or triggers that cause nausea.

Encourage the patient to avoid an empty stomach by eating small meals throughout the day.

il] Schedule weekly visits to monitor weight.

Inquire as to food aversions and vomiting during prenatal visits.

Bi] Monitor electrolytes and fluid intake with each visit.

So close!

Rationale

There is no one treatment that will benefit all women who experience nausea and vomiting with pregnancy.
However, some patients experience prolonged severe nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis gravidarum.
Patients who have experienced this once are prone to be hospitalized with each subsequent pregnancy.
Therefore steps should be implemented to prevent this if possible. Monitoring weight, electrolytes, and fluids
is integral in ensuring the nutritional needs are being met. Therefore inquiring as to any food aversions and
vomiting will be needed to determine whether nutrition is being maintained. All patients with nausea and
vomiting would be advised to avoid smells or triggers that cause nausea and avoid an empty stomach by
eating small meals throughout the day. These, however, are not interventions specific to preventing
hospitalization caused by hyperemesis gravidarum.

p. 161
Question 39

Which dietary intake would account for the difference in protein needs between a lactating
mother and a nonlactating adult woman?
O 20z tofu

© 1ozalmonds
© 1/2 c black beans
@ @ 3.5 02 chicken breast

That's right!

Rationale

The dietary reference intake of protein is 46 g for nonlactating adult women and 71 g for lactating mothers.
The difference is 25 g, which the lactating mother can meet by consuming 3.5 oz of chicken breast. The
amount of protein in 2 07 of tofu, 1 0z of almonds, or 1/2 ¢ of black beans alone is insufficient to account for
this difference.

p. 156
Question 40

After laboratory results of a 24-hour urine sample for a patient with gestational
hypertension indicate protein equal to or higher than 300 mg/d, which dietary instruction
would be recommended?
© © Decrease the amount of red meat in the diet.
@ O Drink three full glasses of milk each day.
Reduce salt intake and hi; cured meats.
duce salt intake and highly cured

O Add a serving of legumes or beans to meals.

So close!

Rationale

Preeclampsia is defined as gestational hypertension with proteinuria (»300 mg/d protein in 24-hour urine) or
end-organ dysfunction. An overall healthy diet before and during pregnancy containing a high intake of plant-
based food, antioxidants, and high fiber is thought to be helpful. However, an increase in vitamin D has been
known to aid in decreasing gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and a recommended three glasses of
vitamin D-fortified milk per day should be included in the diet. Reducing red meat is not suggested because
this is a source of iron. Salt restriction is inappropriate because it does not prevent or help treat symptoms.
‘Adding beans and legumes to each meal is not required, although a routine intake of these foods is good for
folate.

Question 41

A patient with a history of gestational diabetes has just delivered her second child within a
2-year period. Which protocol would the nurse recommend when discussing postnatal
follow-up for this patient? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Il] Blood pressure should be monitored on a regular basis.

Maintain a healthy weight and body mass index (BMI).

it
Bi] Continue to monitor for type 2 diabetes.
it

Physical examinations should be completed every 6 months.

Ensure glucose tolerance testing is completed every year.

So close!

Rationale

Women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a higher risk for developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
and hypertension. Therefore blood pressure should be monitored regularly, as well as weight and BMI and
blood glucose levels. However, a glucose tolerance test is not a yearly required test. Physical examinations
should still be yearly until the health care provider deems more frequent visits are needed.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: If you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about
that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie
diet).

p. 166
Question 42

Which factor accounts for the increased caloric needs of lactating mothers? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

il] The energy content of milk

The metabolic work of milk production

The energy expenditure of the active mother

Bi] Maintenance of maternal adipose tissue storage

i] The decreased metabolic rate of the postpartum mother

So close!

Rationale

The recommended caloric increase is 330 kcal/day (plus 170 kcal/day from maternal stores) in the first 6
months and 400 kcal/day in the second 6 months of breastfeeding (beyond the usual adult allowance). This
additional energy need for the overall total lactation process is based on four factors: the energy content of
milk, the metabolic work of milk production, the energy expenditure of the active mother, and maintenance of

maternal adipose tissue storage. The metabolic rate of the postpartum, lactating mother is increased, not
decreased.

p.170
Question 43

When using the Daily Food Plan for Moms to determine nutrition needs for lactating
mothers, which factor is taken into consideration? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [BM Infant's age

ll] Presence of prolactin inhibitors

‘Amount of fat stored during pregnancy

@ [B Amount of breast milk the mom is producing

li] Mother's age, height, weight, and physical activity level

So close!

Rationale

The Daily Food Plan for Moms takes into consideration the age of the infant who is being breastfed. The
amount of breast milk that the mom is producing is one of the factors taken into consideration when using
the Daily Food Plan for Moms to offer individualized recommendations for lactating mothers. The mother’s
age, height, weight, and physical activity level are used to evaluate her nutrition needs using the Daily Food
Plan for Moms. The presence of prolactin inhibitors is a factor that may contribute to early cessation of
breastfeeding; this is not taken into account when using the Daily Food Plan for Moms. The extra fat stored in
the mother during pregnancy helps meet some of the extra energy needs when breastfeeding, but this is not a
factor when using the Daily Food Plan for Moms.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Rationale
Oxytocin increases after delivery of the baby (not before the onset of labor) and when the infant suckles at the
breast. It may also increase when a breastfeeding mother hears any infant cry, which may stimulate the let-

down reflex. Oxytocin does not increase during weaning or when the colostrum transitions to milk.

Psychologic factors like stress may lead to early cessation of breastfeeding. Fatigue is a factor that is a prolactin
inhibitor leading to early cessation of breastfeeding. Medical complications are a contributing factor to early
cessation of breastfeeding. Lack of support from family or friends is a prolactin inhibitor, which may lead to
the early cessation of breastfeeding. Poor self-efficacy is a negative psychologic factor that may lead to early

Question 58

When attempting to meet the nutritional needs of diverse clients during pregnancy, what is
the most important factor to consider?

© Patients from diverse cultures may need to broaden their food choices.
@ ©@ Specific nutrients, not specific foods, are required for a successful pregnancy.
©) Personal cultural food patterns may not support the needs of the pregnancy.

©) Pregnancy may require that the client alter cultural and religious food practices.

That's right!

Rationale

It is important for the nurse to remember that specific nutrients, not specific foods, are required for a
successful pregnancy. Nurses should encourage clients to use foods that best serve their nutritional needs and
respect their cultural food patterns. Although it may be necessary for clients to broaden their food choices, this
is not necessarily a true statement and is not the most important for the nurse to remember. The broad
statement that personal cultural and religious food patterns will not support a successful pregnancy is not
necessarily true. Although there may be a need to alter some practices, this would not be the best choice nor

the most important for the nurse to consider.

© @ 5.010 7.5 kg

So close!

Rationale

The target weight gain for the first trimester is 0.5 kg to 2.0 kg. The ranges 2.0 to 3.5 kg, 3.5 to 5.0 kg, and 5.0
to 7.5 kg are all higher than the target weight gain for the first trimester.

Question 60

Which guidance can be given to the pregnant client to help address heartburn associated
with pregnancy? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Eat several small meals a day.
© [BB] Increase fluid intake.
[_] Use pyridoxine supplements daily.
@ [BB] Avoid eating large meals at one sitting.
@ [BB] Avoid lying down immediately after a meal.

So close!

Rationale

Heartburn secondary to gastric reflux sometimes occurs with pregnancy and can be relieved by breaking the
daily food requirements into several small meals, not eating a large meal at one time, and not lying down
after a meal. Pyridoxine supplements help address hyperemesis, not heartburn. Increased fluid intake can help

address constipation, not heartburn.

p. 162
Question 61

The nurse is interviewing a mother 4 months postpartum who has recently returned to her
office job. She finds it challenging to stimulate her let-down reflex using a breast pump
while away from her infant. The client explains that she expresses milk in a small office
without a lock on the door and is always worried a coworker will come in. Which hormone
is most likely being inhibited during the mother’s pumping sessions?

© © Prolactin

@ © Ovytocin
© Estrogen
©) Progesterone

So close!

Rationale

The suckling infant stimulates the brain’s release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland to initiate
the let-down reflex for the release of milk from storage cells to travel down to the nipple. This reflex is easily
inhibited by the mother’s fatigue, tension, or lack of confidence. Transitioning from a suckling infant to a
breast pump stimulating the release of oxytocin can be a challenge in itself. Prolactin, progesterone, and
estrogen are involved in the production of milk, not the let-down reflex specifically.

P. 169
Question 62

Which component of human milk most accounts for the breastfed infant’s improved
immune system functioning?

tx} © Colostrum

iv) O Antibodies
© Fatty acids
O Prolactin

So close!

Rationale

The antibodies in human milk that are passed to the nursing infant make a significant contribution to the
infant’s immune system. This accounts for the reduced risk of many diseases and infections. Colostrum is not
a component of milk; it is the first milk produced after birth and is rich in antibodies. Human milk contains
fatty acids, but they do not directly account for the infant’s improved immune system functioning. Prolactin is
a hormone that stimulates milk production, not a component of breast milk.

Test-Taking Tip: Sometimes the reading of a question in the middle or toward the end of an exam may trigger
your mind with the answer or provide an important clue to an earlier question.

Question 63

Which part of the mother’s body receives a nerve impulse when the infant suckles at the
breast?

O Anterior pituitary
O Posterior pituitary

@ ©@ Hypothalamus

O Thalamus

That's right!

Rationale
When an infant is allowed to suckle after birth, a nerve impulse is sent to the mother’s hypothalamus. This
stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete prolactin, which then stimulates milk production in the alveolar

cells. Oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary. The thalamus is not directly involved in this process.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

P. 169
Question 64

What is the dietary reference intake (DRI) for vitamin D in lactating mothers?
© 5mcg/d
@ @ 15 mg/d

© 150 meg/d
© 1500 meg/d

That's right!

Rationale

The DRI for vitamin D in pregnant and lactating women is 15 mcg/d. The DRI does not recommend 5, 150, or
1500 mcg/d.

p. 158
Question 65

Which food is a good source for DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [) Egg yolks and algae
[| Milk, yogurt, and other dairy products

iv) [ml] Fish and seafood

|_| Liver, legumes, and green leafy vegetables

|_| Yellow vegetables and fruits

That's right!

Rationale

Egg yolks and algae as well as fish and seafood are rich in DHA. Milk, yogurt, and other dairy products are
good sources of calcium, not DHA. Liver, legumes, and green leafy vegetables are good sources of iron, not
DHA. Vitamin A, not DHA, is provided by yellow vegetables and fruits.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 156
Question 66

Which range is the target weight gain for all pregnant women during the first trimester?
@ ©@ 0.5 to 2.0 kg

© 2.0 to 3.5 kg

© 3.5 to 5.0 kg

© 5.0 to 7.5 kg

That's right!

Rationale

The target weight gain for the first trimester is 0.5 kg to 2.0 kg. The ranges 2.0 to 3.5 kg, 3.5 to 5.0 kg, and 5.0
to 7.5 kg are all higher than the target weight gain for the first trimester.

p. 159
Question 67

Which resource can assist lactating mothers in finding healthy meal options that meet their
nutritional requirements? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [| MyPlate.gov
@ |) La Leche League

© [Bm] American Academy of Pediatrics
|_| National Center for Health Statistics

@ |B] Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)

So close!

Rationale

MyPlate.gov, La Leche League, and WIC are valuable resources for nutrition information for lactating mothers.
MyPlate.gov includes specific categories for pregnancy and lactation. La Leche League and WIC include
mother-to-mother support in their offerings, which could help the client brainstorm meal ideas. The
American Academy of Pediatrics focuses on infant and child health. The National Center for Health Statistics
provides standard growth charts for infants and children.

p. 170
Question 68

Which reason is associated with increased protein needs during pregnancy? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [B] Development of the placenta
iv) [ml] Growth of maternal tissues
iv) [ml] Increased maternal blood volume

iv) [ml] Amniotic fluid

iv) [ml] Growth of the fetus

That's right!

Rationale

During pregnancy, the development of the placenta requires sufficient protein to sustain, support, and
nourish the fetus. Increased protein is required for the development of uterine and breast tissue to support

pregnancy and lactation. Hemoglobin, albumin, and other blood components vital to pregnancy require
increased protein as the mother’s plasma volume increases. Amniotic fluid contains various proteins, and the
need for protein increases as the pregnancy progresses. There is a relatively large amount of protein needed

for the rapid growth of the fetus during pregnancy.

p. 156
Question 69

For which nutrient is the dietary reference intakes (DRIs) increased during pregnancy?
Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[_] Vitamin D
|_| Fluoride
@ [B] Zinc
@ [B) Niacin
[| Calcium

That's right!

Rationale
The DRIs recommend increased zinc and niacin during pregnancy, but intake of vitamin D, fluoride, and

calcium can remain the same.

p. 157
Question 70

Which guidance can be given to the pregnant client to help address heartburn associated

with pregnancy? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Eat several small meals a day.
[_] Increase fluid intake.
[_] Use pyridoxine supplements daily.
@ [BB] Avoid eating large meals at one sitting.
@ [BB] Avoid lying down immediately after a meal.

That's right!

Rationale

Heartburn secondary to gastric reflux sometimes occurs with pregnancy and can be relieved by breaking the
daily food requirements into several small meals, not eating a large meal at one time, and not lying down
after a meal. Pyridoxine supplements help address hyperemesis, not heartburn. Increased fluid intake can help

address constipation, not heartburn.

p. 162
Question 71

The nurse is interviewing a mother 4 months postpartum who has recently returned to her
office job. She finds it challenging to stimulate her let-down reflex using a breast pump
while away from her infant. The client explains that she expresses milk in a small office
without a lock on the door and is always worried a coworker will come in. Which hormone
is most likely being inhibited during the mother’s pumping sessions?

O Prolactin

ivy) © Oxytocin
O Estrogen
O Progesterone

That's right!

Rationale

The suckling infant stimulates the brain’s release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland to initiate
the let-down reflex for the release of milk from storage cells to travel down to the nipple. This reflex is easily
inhibited by the mother’s fatigue, tension, or lack of confidence. Transitioning from a suckling infant to a
breast pump stimulating the release of oxytocin can be a challenge in itself. Prolactin, progesterone, and
estrogen are involved in the production of milk, not the let-down reflex specifically.

P. 169
Question 72

What is the daily recommended fluid intake for breastfeeding mothers?

That's right!

Rationale
Because milk is a fluid, breastfeeding mothers need ample fluids for adequate milk production. Their fluid

intake should be approximately 3 to 4 L per day. Water and other sources of fluid such as juices, milk, and
soup contribute to the fluid that is necessary to produce milk. The amount 1 to 2 Lis not enough, and 5 to 6 L

and 7 to 8 L are more than necessary.

p. 170
Question 73

Which daily lifestyle information would the nurse discuss with a patient to decrease risk for

prolactin inhibitors? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

|_| Engage in aerobic exercise to reduce stored fat content from pregnancy.
@ [BB] Drink plenty of liquids throughout the day to maintain proper hydration.
@ |B] Rest when the baby sleeps to prevent fatigue.
@ |B] Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation.

@ |B] Establish a routine for both mom and baby.

That's right!

Rationale

Patients may have a difficult time with lactation because of nutrition and hydration issues, rest, exercise, and

relaxation. There are also prolactin inhibitors such as stress, fatigue, medical complications, lack of support,
poor self-efficiency, and irregular breastfeeding schedule that can affect lactation. Therefore the nurse would
provide information on ways to reduce the risk for developing these inhibitors such as drinking plenty of
liquids, resting when baby rests, practicing meditation or other stress-relieving exercises, and establishing a
routine for both mom and baby. The fat stored from pregnancy is needed for the extra energy supply needed

during lactation.

p.171
Question 74

Which pregnant patient would have the highest nutritional risk for pregnancy
complications?

@ @ 4 40-year-old patient of low socioeconomic status with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5
© Asingle 18-year-old patient with a BMI of 20.5
© A 30-year-old patient with a BMI of 22 who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day

© A 24-year-old patient with a BMI of 21 who maintains a vegetarian diet

That's right!

Rationale

Age over 35, BMI below 18.5, and low socioeconomic status at the onset of pregnancy may lead to pregnancy
complications, placing the 40-year-old patient at the highest risk. The 18-year-old patient with a BMI of 20.5
and single status does not have any indicated nutritional risk factors. The 30-year-old patient with a BMI of
22 who smokes has one risk factor: smoking. The 24-year-old patient with a BMI of 21 who is a vegetarian has
no risk factors.

p. 162
Question 75

Which helps meet some of the extra energy needs required by lactation in the postpartum
mother?

© Protein stores in the placenta
© Protein stores in the breast tissue
© Adipose tissue deposited in the fetus during gestation

@ ©@ Adipose tissue deposited in the mother during pregnancy

That's right!

Rationale

Some of the extra energy needs required by lactation in the postpartum mother are met by the adipose tissue
that is deposited in her body during pregnancy. The rest are met by increased caloric intake. Protein stores in
the placenta do not meet these needs because the mother delivers the placenta after she delivers the baby.
Protein is not stored in breast tissue, and adipose tissue is not deposited in the fetus for this purpose.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 170
Question 76

Why is human milk the ideal first food for human infants?

© It contains high levels of iron and vitamin D.
@ ©@ Its nutrient content regularly changes to meet the infant's needs.
© Itis low in fat and sugar, which establishes early healthy eating habits.

© Itis nearly identical in nutrient content to cow’s milk, making the transition to cow’s milk smoother.

That's right!

Rationale

Human milk changes to meet changing nutrient and energy needs of the newborn and the maturing infant
during the first months of life. It is always there in the correct form to meet the growing infant’s needs.
Human milk may not provide sufficient levels of iron and vitamin D after 6 months. The macronutrient
content of human milk changes to meet the infant’s needs, but it is not considered a low-fat or low-sugar

food. The nutrient contents of human milk and cow’s milk vary considerably.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal

the correct answer.

p.171
Question 77

Which statement reflects an accurate understanding of sources of easily absorbed forms of
folate?

©) "Liver, pinto beans, asparagus, and broccoli all provide easily absorbed forms of folate."
@ ©@ "Enriched grain and flour products and fortified cereals are great sources of easily absorbed folate."

©) "Itis best to increase my intake of milk products because milk helps increase the uptake of folate from
foods."

© "Folate is not easily absorbed from dietary foods, so supplements are required throughout
pregnancy."

That's right!

Rationale

Enriched grain, flour products, and fortified cereals are sources of easily absorbed forms of folate. Liver, pinto
beans, broccoli, and asparagus are sources of folate but are not easily absorbed forms of it. Milk does not
increase folate absorption. Many foods are available that can supply easily absorbed folate; a supplement is not
required unless the client is unable to meet the requirements via dietary food intake.

p. 158
Question 78

Which vitamin should be supplemented at least 2 months before conception to help

prevent neural tube defects?

iv) © Folate

O Vitamin A
O Vitamin D
O Ascorbic acid

That's right!

Rationale

Folate supports adequate nutrient availability for the endometrial lining to support embryonic tissue
development. The neural tube forms very early in the pregnancy (21 to 28 days), so taking folate before
conception helps ensure the necessary support. Vitamin A, vitamin D, and ascorbic acid are not recommended

for preventing neural tube defects.

p. 158
Question 79

For up to how many months is breastfeeding recommended?

That's right!

Rationale

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Academy of Pediatrics encourage and strongly

support breastfeeding for all able mothers for the first 12 months of life and continued thereafter for as long
as mutually desired.

p.171
Question 80

A lactating mother is feeling anxiety because her let-down reflex takes longer than she
thinks it should. What is the most therapeutic response?

© "If breastfeeding is too challenging, there is no reason you shouldn't switch to using formula."

© "Colostrum is secreted before the let-down reflex occurs, so your baby is still getting good nutrition
the whole time."

© "You might be surprised, but having a small amount of alcohol can help you relax enough to
stimulate the let-down reflex."

@ @ "Every woman is different, and there is no correct time in which let-down should occur. If your baby is
healthy and growing, you’re doing great."

That's right!

Rationale

The most therapeutic response from the nurse is, "Every woman is different, and there is no correct time in
which let-down should occur. If your baby is healthy and growing, you’re doing great." The nurse should
provide support and resources to encourage breastfeeding rather than automatically recommend that the
client switch to using formula. Colostrum is secreted during the first few days postpartum, not before let-
down. Alcohol can actually inhibit the let-down reflex, and it passes through milk to the nursing child, so it

should not be recommended.

Test-Taking Tip: Look for answers that focus on the client or are directed toward feelings.

p.171
Question 81

The nursing student is learning about what a mother experiences while lactating. Which
statement by the student requires correction by the instructor?

@ ©@ “Atingling sensation in the breast may indicate mastitis or a plugged duct."
© "Colostrum may be secreted from the breast during late pregnancy."
© "During pregnancy, estrogen stimulates proliferation of the ductal system."

© "Oxytocin is involved in stimulating both uterine contractions and milk ejection."

That's right!

Rationale
Many women experience a tingling sensation in the breast when let-down of milk occurs. This sensation is

normal and is not a sign of mastitis, plugged duct, or other complications. It is true that colostrum may be
secreted from the breast during late pregnancy, estrogen stimulates proliferation of the ductal system, and

oxytocin is involved in stimulating both uterine contractions and milk ejection.

P. 169
Question 82

Which dietary intake would account for the difference in protein needs between a lactating
mother and a nonlactating adult woman?

© 20z tofu
© 1ozalmonds
© 1/2 ¢ black beans
@ @ 3.5 0z chicken breast

That's right!

Rationale

The dietary reference intake of protein is 46 g for nonlactating adult women and 71 g for lactating mothers.
The difference is 25 g, which the lactating mother can meet by consuming 3.5 oz of chicken breast. The
amount of protein in 2 oz of tofu, 1 oz of almonds, or 1/2 c of black beans alone is insufficient to account for
this difference.

p. 156
Question 83

Which would be critical to discuss with the health care team of a pregnant patient with a
history of eating disorders to include in the plan of care to support a successful outcome?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Postpartum care

|_| Breastfeeding to support weight loss after delivery
@ [B) Emphasis on nutritional needs of the growing fetus
@ [BB] Anticipated maternal body size and shape changes

|_| The need to prioritize the baby over oneself

That's right!

Rationale
For individuals with bulimia nervosa who are pregnant, the health care team should focus on postpartum

care, emphasize nutritional needs of the growing fetus, and discuss anticipated maternal body size and shape
changes to best support a successful pregnancy outcome. Breastfeeding should not be discussed in terms of
its possible role in helping keep weight down, nor should the patient be told not to focus on herself
throughout the pregnancy because the health of both mother and baby are important.

p. 159
Question 84

What is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy?

© @ Blood loss
@ O Iron deficiency

© Kidney disease
©) Folate deficiency

So close!

Rationale
Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia during pregnancy. Blood loss and kidney disease can
also cause anemia, but they are not the most common causes. Folate deficiency can result in neural tube

defects, not anemia, for the fetus.

p. 165
Question 85

Which statement is most accurate concerning alcohol use during pregnancy?

@ @ "No safe level of alcohol use has been established for pregnant women."
© "One to two glasses of wine per week are acceptable in the last trimester."
© "Even minor alcohol use will result in fetal alcohol syndrome and mental retardation."

© "You should avoid hard liquor, but beverages with lower alcohol content can be safely consumed in
moderation."

That's right!

Rationale

No safe level of alcohol consumption has been determined for pregnant women. Because no safe level of
alcohol use has been established, stating that one to two glasses of wine are acceptable would not be accurate.
Extensive or habitual alcohol use may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, and minor alcohol use may be
dangerous to the fetus. However, the exact impact is unknown. There is no established safe level of alcohol

use, regardless of alcohol content.

p. 163
Question 86

Which statement shows an understanding of foods that are good sources of complete
protein foods?

@ @ "Ican get complete proteins from foods like eggs, milk, and beef."
© "Beans, peas, and lentils are all great sources of complete proteins.’
© "Good sources of complete proteins are items from the grains group."

© "Nuts would be a good snack to help provide a source of complete proteins."

That's right!

Rationale

Complete proteins can be found in eggs, milk, and beef. Legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils; grains; and
nuts are all sources of incomplete proteins, not complete proteins.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p. 156
Question 87

If a woman’s pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 26.5, which range of total
pregnancy weight gain in pounds would be recommended to this client?

© 11 to 20
@ @ 151025
© 25 to 35

© 28 to 40

That's right!

Rationale

A BMI of 26.5 places the client in the overweight category, so the total recommended weight gain is 15 to 25
Ib. A total weight gain of 11 to 20 Ib is recommended for a woman categorized as obese by BMI. A total weight
gain of 25 to 35 |b is recommended for a woman categorized as normal weight by BMI. A total weight gain of
28 to 40 Ib is recommended for a woman categorized as underweight by BMI.

p. 161
Question 88

Which vitamin must be increased to support nutrition needs during pregnancy? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Vitamin A
iv) [ml] Vitamin C

[| Vitamin E
[| Vitamin K

@ |B] Vitamin B complex

That's right!

Rationale

During pregnancy, increased amounts of vitamins A, C, and B complex are needed for additional collagen

needs for tissue expansion and red blood cell production. No increases are needed in vitamins E and K if they

are already consumed in sufficient amounts.

pp. 158-159
Question 89

For which complication are clients at higher risk if they did not gain adequate weight
during pregnancy?

© Anencephaly
O Malformed facial features

© Inadequate fetal bone growth
@ ©@ Small-for-gestational-age infant

That's right!

Rationale

Patients who are underweight (body mass index [BMI] less than 18.5) at the start of pregnancy should have a
total weight gain between 28 and 40 |b. Low maternal weight gain is a predictor of small-for-gestational-age
infants. Anencephaly can result from folate deficiency, not low weight gain. Malformed facial features can
result from alcohol use, not low weight gain, during pregnancy. Inadequate fetal bone growth may result from

lack of vitamin D, not low weight gain during pregnancy.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in

one or two of the options.

p. 159
Question 90

When supplementing infant feedings with breast milk substitutes or formula, which
complication may result?

© The infant may become dehydrated.
© The infant may not receive enough calories.
© The mammary glands may revert to producing colostrum.

@ @ The mammary glands may produce less milk in response to fewer infant feedings.

That's right!

Rationale

each time that the infant feeds. Therefore the more milk that is taken from the breast, the more milk the
mother produces. If the infant requires supplemental feedings, the mammary glands may in turn produce
less milk. If caregivers follow formula preparation and feeding instructions properly, the infant should not
become dehydrated or receive too few calories. The mammary glands are not at risk of reverting to the
production of colostrum.

P. 169
Question 91

Which hormone is responsible for the phenomenon of a breastfeeding mother’s milk
leaking when she sees another infant?

O Prolactin

iv) © Oxytocin
O Estrogen
O Progesterone

That's right!

Rationale

If a mother sees or hears another infant, she may experience a let-down accompanied by a rush of milk
ejecting from her breasts. Oxytocin is responsible for this let-down reflex, not prolactin, estrogen, or
progesterone.

P. 169
Question 92

Due to uncertainties about the fetal effects of maternal consumption of caffeine, what
maximum amount should the nurse recommend to newly pregnant clients to prevent
possible complications such as first-trimester spontaneous abortion?

© @ Omg/day
© 100 mg/day

@ © 300 mg/day

© 500 mg/day

So close!

Rationale

Caffeine can cross the placenta and enter fetal circulation. Most health institutions recommend limiting
caffeine intake to a maximum of 300 mg/day. The maximum recommended daily caffeine intake is more than
0 mg and 100 mg. First-trimester spontaneous abortion has been associated with caffeine intake of 500
mg/day or greater.

p. 164
Question 93

What is the daily recommended fluid intake for breastfeeding mothers?

That's right!

Rationale
Because milk is a fluid, breastfeeding mothers need ample fluids for adequate milk production. Their fluid

intake should be approximately 3 to 4 L per day. Water and other sources of fluid such as juices, milk, and
soup contribute to the fluid that is necessary to produce milk. The amount 1 to 2 Lis not enough, and 5 to 6 L

and 7 to 8 L are more than necessary.

p. 170
Question 94

When attempting to meet the nutritional needs of diverse clients during pregnancy, what is
the most important factor to consider?

© Patients from diverse cultures may need to broaden their food choices.
@ ©@ Specific nutrients, not specific foods, are required for a successful pregnancy.
©) Personal cultural food patterns may not support the needs of the pregnancy.

©) Pregnancy may require that the client alter cultural and religious food practices.

That's right!

Rationale

It is important for the nurse to remember that specific nutrients, not specific foods, are required for a
successful pregnancy. Nurses should encourage clients to use foods that best serve their nutritional needs and
respect their cultural food patterns. Although it may be necessary for clients to broaden their food choices, this
is not necessarily a true statement and is not the most important for the nurse to remember. The broad
statement that personal cultural and religious food patterns will not support a successful pregnancy is not
necessarily true. Although there may be a need to alter some practices, this would not be the best choice nor

the most important for the nurse to consider.

p. 160
Question 95

What is the estimated increased calorie recommendations for the lactating mother in the
first 6 months of lactation?

© 130 kcal/day
@ @ 330 kcal/day
© 530 kcal/day
© 730 kcal/day

That's right!

Rationale

Lactation requires energy for both the process of milk production and the actual milk. The extra fat that is
stored in the mother during pregnancy will meet some of the extra energy needs. The increased calorie
recommendations are 330 kcal/day (plus 170 kcal/day from maternal stores) during the first 6 months of
lactation.

p. 170
Question 96

Which daily lifestyle information would the nurse discuss with a patient to decrease risk for

prolactin inhibitors? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

|_| Engage in aerobic exercise to reduce stored fat content from pregnancy.
@ [BB] Drink plenty of liquids throughout the day to maintain proper hydration.
@ |B] Rest when the baby sleeps to prevent fatigue.
@ |B] Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation.

@ |B] Establish a routine for both mom and baby.

That's right!

Rationale

Patients may have a difficult time with lactation because of nutrition and hydration issues, rest, exercise, and

relaxation. There are also prolactin inhibitors such as stress, fatigue, medical complications, lack of support,
poor self-efficiency, and irregular breastfeeding schedule that can affect lactation. Therefore the nurse would
provide information on ways to reduce the risk for developing these inhibitors such as drinking plenty of
liquids, resting when baby rests, practicing meditation or other stress-relieving exercises, and establishing a
routine for both mom and baby. The fat stored from pregnancy is needed for the extra energy supply needed

during lactation.

p.171
Question 97

Which pregnant patient would have the highest nutritional risk for pregnancy
complications?

@ @ 4 40-year-old patient of low socioeconomic status with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5
© Asingle 18-year-old patient with a BMI of 20.5
© A 30-year-old patient with a BMI of 22 who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day

© A 24-year-old patient with a BMI of 21 who maintains a vegetarian diet

That's right!

Rationale

Age over 35, BMI below 18.5, and low socioeconomic status at the onset of pregnancy may lead to pregnancy
complications, placing the 40-year-old patient at the highest risk. The 18-year-old patient with a BMI of 20.5
and single status does not have any indicated nutritional risk factors. The 30-year-old patient with a BMI of
22 who smokes has one risk factor: smoking. The 24-year-old patient with a BMI of 21 who is a vegetarian has
no risk factors.

p. 162
Question 98

When assessing an adolescent pregnant patient, on which area of concern would the nurse
focus to develop a prenatal plan of care? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses
may be correct.

@ [BB] Accessibility to prenatal care

[_] Family history of low-birth-weight births
@ |B] Social behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption
@ |B] Patient’s feeling about the pregnancy and health status

iv) [ml] Socioeconomic status and needs

That's right!

Rationale

Adolescent pregnancies are more likely to have pregnancy complications and poor outcomes such as infant
mortality, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. Adolescents are also likely to have many emotional and
nutritional risks. Therefore the nurse would concentrate on the patient’s accessibility to the health care
provider for prenatal care and socioeconomic status, which would address support, care, and nutritional
needs. Also, determining social behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, will help develop a plan
to stop these behaviors to prevent low birth weight and infant mortality. Determining how the patient feels
about the pregnancy and health status will guide the nurse in determining psychosocial needs. Family history

of low-birth-weight births is not directly correlated to the patient’s risk for problems related to pregnancy and
birth.

p. 162
Question 99

Which intervention would be implemented for a pregnant patient with a prior history of
hyperemesis gravidarum to prevent hospitalization? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

|_| Educate the patient on avoiding smells or triggers that cause nausea.

[_] Encourage the patient to avoid an empty stomach by eating small meals throughout the day.
@ |] Schedule weekly visits to monitor weight.
@ [BB] Inquire as to food aversions and vomiting during prenatal visits.

@ [B] Monitor electrolytes and fluid intake with each visit.

That's right!

Rationale

There is no one treatment that will benefit all women who experience nausea and vomiting with pregnancy.
However, some patients experience prolonged severe nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis gravidarum.
Patients who have experienced this once are prone to be hospitalized with each subsequent pregnancy.
Therefore steps should be implemented to prevent this if possible. Monitoring weight, electrolytes, and fluids
is integral in ensuring the nutritional needs are being met. Therefore inquiring as to any food aversions and
vomiting will be needed to determine whether nutrition is being maintained. All patients with nausea and
vomiting would be advised to avoid smells or triggers that cause nausea and avoid an empty stomach by
eating small meals throughout the day. These, however, are not interventions specific to preventing

hospitalization caused by hyperemesis gravidarum.

p. 161
Question 100

After laboratory results of a 24-hour urine sample for a patient with gestational
hypertension indicate protein equal to or higher than 300 mg/d, which dietary instruction

would be recommended?

© Decrease the amount of red meat in the diet.
@ © Drink three full glasses of milk each day.
© Reduce salt intake and highly cured meats.

© Add a serving of legumes or beans to meals.

That's right!

Rationale

Preeclampsia is defined as gestational hypertension with proteinuria (>300 mg/d protein in 24-hour urine) or
end-organ dysfunction. An overall healthy diet before and during pregnancy containing a high intake of plant-
based food, antioxidants, and high fiber is thought to be helpful. However, an increase in vitamin D has been
known to aid in decreasing gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, and a recommended three glasses of
vitamin D-fortified milk per day should be included in the diet. Reducing red meat is not suggested because
this is a source of iron. Salt restriction is inappropriate because it does not prevent or help treat symptoms.
Adding beans and legumes to each meal is not required, although a routine intake of these foods is good for

folate.

Question 101

A patient with a history of gestational diabetes has just delivered her second child within a
2-year period. Which protocol would the nurse recommend when discussing postnatal

follow-up for this patient? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

@ |B] Blood pressure should be monitored on a regular basis.
@ [B] Maintain a healthy weight and body mass index (BMI).
@ [B] Continue to monitor for type 2 diabetes.

|_| Physical examinations should be completed every 6 months.

|_| Ensure glucose tolerance testing is completed every year.

That's right!

Rationale

Women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a higher risk for developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
and hypertension. Therefore blood pressure should be monitored regularly, as well as weight and BMI and
blood glucose levels. However, a glucose tolerance test is not a yearly required test. Physical examinations
should still be yearly until the health care provider deems more frequent visits are needed.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: If you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about

that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie

diet).

p. 166
Question 102

Which helps meet some of the extra energy needs required by lactation in the postpartum
mother?

© Protein stores in the placenta
© Protein stores in the breast tissue
© Adipose tissue deposited in the fetus during gestation

@ ©@ Adipose tissue deposited in the mother during pregnancy

That's right!

Rationale

Some of the extra energy needs required by lactation in the postpartum mother are met by the adipose tissue
that is deposited in her body during pregnancy. The rest are met by increased caloric intake. Protein stores in
the placenta do not meet these needs because the mother delivers the placenta after she delivers the baby.
Protein is not stored in breast tissue, and adipose tissue is not deposited in the fetus for this purpose.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 170
Question 103

Why is human milk the ideal first food for human infants?

© It contains high levels of iron and vitamin D.
@ ©@ Its nutrient content regularly changes to meet the infant's needs.
© Itis low in fat and sugar, which establishes early healthy eating habits.

© Itis nearly identical in nutrient content to cow’s milk, making the transition to cow’s milk smoother.

That's right!

Rationale

Human milk changes to meet changing nutrient and energy needs of the newborn and the maturing infant
during the first months of life. It is always there in the correct form to meet the growing infant’s needs.
Human milk may not provide sufficient levels of iron and vitamin D after 6 months. The macronutrient
content of human milk changes to meet the infant’s needs, but it is not considered a low-fat or low-sugar

food. The nutrient contents of human milk and cow’s milk vary considerably.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal

the correct answer.

p.171
Question 104

Which statement is correct regarding meeting nutrition needs during the second trimester
without gaining excess weight?

© "It is more important that you worry about what you are eating rather than about the amount of
weight you are gaining."

© "You will need an extra 500 to 700 kilocalories per day in the second trimester; let’s discuss the best
way to get these kilocalories."

© @ “You are eating for two, so when you eat, try to make sure you are eating just enough to provide the
necessary dietary support."

@ © "In the second trimester, you can meet additional kilocalorie needs by adding one snack a day, like a
banana or yogurt."

So close!

Rationale

During the second trimester of pregnancy, the increased kilocalorie needs can be met with one additional
snack a day, such as a banana, a serving of yogurt, or a serving of nuts. Although it is important for the
mother to worry about where the extra kilocalories are coming from, it is also important to be mindful of
weight gain because excessive weight gain can potentially lead to complications for the fetus. During the
second trimester, an extra 340 kilocalories per day are needed, not 500 to 700 kilocalories. "Eating for two" is a
fallacy that can lead to misunderstandings and should not be a phrase nurses use.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p. 155
Question 105

Which factor is most likely to present challenges to breastfeeding? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [B] Maternal fatigue and stress

[_] Smaller than average breast size
@ [B] Moderate consumption of alcohol
@ [BB] A diet consisting of 1600 kcal/day

[_] Failure to increase vitamin D above pregnancy levels

That's right!

Rationale

Maternal fatigue and stress may present a challenge to breastfeeding by inhibiting the let-down reflex. Even
moderate consumption of alcohol may also inhibit the let-down reflex. A diet consisting of 1600 kcal/day is
below the recommended minimum energy intake to sustain adequate lactation. Breast size is not a
determinant of successful breastfeeding. The dietary reference intake for vitamin D is the same for lactating

and pregnant women.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will

seem like the correct response.

p. 170
Question 106

Which statement reflects an accurate understanding of sources of easily absorbed forms of
folate?

©) "Liver, pinto beans, asparagus, and broccoli all provide easily absorbed forms of folate."
@ ©@ "Enriched grain and flour products and fortified cereals are great sources of easily absorbed folate."

©) "Itis best to increase my intake of milk products because milk helps increase the uptake of folate from
foods."

© "Folate is not easily absorbed from dietary foods, so supplements are required throughout
pregnancy."

That's right!

Rationale

Enriched grain, flour products, and fortified cereals are sources of easily absorbed forms of folate. Liver, pinto
beans, broccoli, and asparagus are sources of folate but are not easily absorbed forms of it. Milk does not
increase folate absorption. Many foods are available that can supply easily absorbed folate; a supplement is not
required unless the client is unable to meet the requirements via dietary food intake.

p. 158
Question 107

Which vitamin should be supplemented at least 2 months before conception to help

prevent neural tube defects?

iv) © Folate

O Vitamin A
O Vitamin D
O Ascorbic acid

That's right!

Rationale

Folate supports adequate nutrient availability for the endometrial lining to support embryonic tissue
development. The neural tube forms very early in the pregnancy (21 to 28 days), so taking folate before
conception helps ensure the necessary support. Vitamin A, vitamin D, and ascorbic acid are not recommended

for preventing neural tube defects.

p. 158
Question 108

Which statement regarding treatment for a pregnant client with severe nausea and
vomiting is untrue?

© "You may find ginger and B ¢ supplements helpful in decreasing nausea.’
@ @ "Make sure to always drink liquids with your meals to help with digestion."
© "Snacks and meals should be fairly dry and bland and low in fat and fiber."

© "Try to always keep some food in your stomach by eating small, frequent meals."

That's right!

Rationale

Pregnant clients suffering from nausea and vomiting should be encouraged to drink liquids between meals,
not with meals; thus this statement requires correction. Ginger and B ¢ supplements can help decrease
nausea. Dry, bland, low-fat, and low-fiber meals and snacks are recommended to combat nausea and
vomiting. Small, frequent meals and snacks to prevent an empty stomach can help with nausea and vomiting.

p. 161
Question 109

For up to how many months is breastfeeding recommended?

That's right!

Rationale

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Academy of Pediatrics encourage and strongly

support breastfeeding for all able mothers for the first 12 months of life and continued thereafter for as long
as mutually desired.

p.171
Question 110

A lactating mother is feeling anxiety because her let-down reflex takes longer than she
thinks it should. What is the most therapeutic response?

© "If breastfeeding is too challenging, there is no reason you shouldn't switch to using formula."

© "Colostrum is secreted before the let-down reflex occurs, so your baby is still getting good nutrition
the whole time."

© "You might be surprised, but having a small amount of alcohol can help you relax enough to
stimulate the let-down reflex."

@ @ "Every woman is different, and there is no correct time in which let-down should occur. If your baby is
healthy and growing, you’re doing great."

That's right!

Rationale

The most therapeutic response from the nurse is, "Every woman is different, and there is no correct time in
which let-down should occur. If your baby is healthy and growing, you’re doing great." The nurse should
provide support and resources to encourage breastfeeding rather than automatically recommend that the
client switch to using formula. Colostrum is secreted during the first few days postpartum, not before let-
down. Alcohol can actually inhibit the let-down reflex, and it passes through milk to the nursing child, so it

should not be recommended.

Test-Taking Tip: Look for answers that focus on the client or are directed toward feelings.

p.171
Question 111

The nursing student is learning about what a mother experiences while lactating. Which
statement by the student requires correction by the instructor?

@ © “Atingling sensation in the breast may indicate mastitis or a plugged duct."
© "Colostrum may be secreted from the breast during late pregnancy."
© © "During pregnancy, estrogen stimulates proliferation of the ductal system."

© "Oxytocin is involved in stimulating both uterine contractions and milk ejection."

So close!

Rationale

Many women experience a tingling sensation in the breast when let-down of milk occurs. This sensation is
normal and is not a sign of mastitis, plugged duct, or other complications. It is true that colostrum may be
secreted from the breast during late pregnancy, estrogen stimulates proliferation of the ductal system, and

oxytocin is involved in stimulating both uterine contractions and milk ejection.

P. 169
Question 112

Which dietary intake would account for the difference in protein needs between a lactating

mother and a nonlactating adult woman?
© 20z tofu

O 1 oz almonds
© 1/2 ¢ black beans
ivy) © 3.5 oz chicken breast

That's right!

Rationale

The dietary reference intake of protein is 46 g for nonlactating adult women and 71 g for lactating mothers.
The difference is 25 g, which the lactating mother can meet by consuming 3.5 oz of chicken breast. The
amount of protein in 2 oz of tofu, 1 oz of almonds, or 1/2 c of black beans alone is insufficient to account for

this difference.

p. 156
Question 113

Which would be critical to discuss with the health care team of a pregnant patient with a
history of eating disorders to include in the plan of care to support a successful outcome?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Postpartum care

|_| Breastfeeding to support weight loss after delivery
@ [B) Emphasis on nutritional needs of the growing fetus
@ [BB] Anticipated maternal body size and shape changes

|_| The need to prioritize the baby over oneself

That's right!

Rationale

For individuals with bulimia nervosa who are pregnant, the health care team should focus on postpartum
care, emphasize nutritional needs of the growing fetus, and discuss anticipated maternal body size and shape
changes to best support a successful pregnancy outcome. Breastfeeding should not be discussed in terms of
its possible role in helping keep weight down, nor should the patient be told not to focus on herself

throughout the pregnancy because the health of both mother and baby are important.

p. 159
Question 114

What is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy?

O Blood loss

@ @ Iron deficiency

© Kidney disease
©) Folate deficiency

That's right!

Rationale
Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia during pregnancy. Blood loss and kidney disease can
also cause anemia, but they are not the most common causes. Folate deficiency can result in neural tube

defects, not anemia, for the fetus.

p. 165
Question 115

Which statement is most accurate concerning alcohol use during pregnancy?

@ @ "No safe level of alcohol use has been established for pregnant women."
© "One to two glasses of wine per week are acceptable in the last trimester."
© "Even minor alcohol use will result in fetal alcohol syndrome and mental retardation."

© "You should avoid hard liquor, but beverages with lower alcohol content can be safely consumed in
moderation."

That's right!

Rationale

No safe level of alcohol consumption has been determined for pregnant women. Because no safe level of
alcohol use has been established, stating that one to two glasses of wine are acceptable would not be accurate.
Extensive or habitual alcohol use may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, and minor alcohol use may be
dangerous to the fetus. However, the exact impact is unknown. There is no established safe level of alcohol

use, regardless of alcohol content.

p. 163
Question 116

Which statement by the nurse concerning the maternal need for increased kilocalories
during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy requires clarification?

© "The metabolic workload of the fetus requires increased fuel."
© "Added tissue-building requirements need more kilocalories to spare protein."
© "More kilocalories are needed to supply increased fuel for the mother’s metabolic workload."

@ ©@ "Kilocalorie needs during the second and third trimesters do not vary significantly from the first."

That's right!

Rationale

More kilocalories are necessary during the second and third trimesters compared with the first trimester,
when the kilocalorie needs are the same as they were before conception. The increased kilocalories are needed
to support the increased demands of the metabolic workload of the fetus, added tissue-building

requirements, and the increased metabolic workload of the mother.

p. 155
Question 117

Which growth need during pregnancy requires sufficient protein? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Amniotic fluid

@ |B] Growth of the fetus
@ [B] Development of the placenta
@ |B] Increased synthesis of hemoglobin and albumin

[_] Absorption and use of calcium for fetal bone growth

That's right!

Rationale

Sufficient protein is needed to support amniotic fluid, rapid growth of the fetus, development of a mature
placenta to support the fetus, and increased synthesis of hemoglobin and albumin secondary to the increased
maternal blood volume required to nourish the fetus and support increased metabolic demands. Vitamin D,

not protein, is necessary for supporting absorption and the use of calcium to support fetal bone growth.

p. 156
Question 118

Which statement shows an understanding of foods that are good sources of complete
protein foods?

@ @ "Ican get complete proteins from foods like eggs, milk, and beef."
© "Beans, peas, and lentils are all great sources of complete proteins.’
© "Good sources of complete proteins are items from the grains group."

© "Nuts would be a good snack to help provide a source of complete proteins."

That's right!

Rationale

Complete proteins can be found in eggs, milk, and beef. Legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils; grains; and
nuts are all sources of incomplete proteins, not complete proteins.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p. 156
Question 119

Which mineral supplement is potentially necessary for mothers expecting multiple births?

O lron
iv) © Calcium

O Potassium

O Magnesium

That's right!

Rationale

Calcium is essential for fetal bone and teeth development, blood clotting, and maternal body needs. Calcium
supplements may be indicated in the case of pregnancies involving more than one fetus. Iron, potassium, and

magnesium supplements are not specifically indicated in cases of multiples.

p. 157
Question 120

If a woman’s pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 26.5, which range of total
pregnancy weight gain in pounds would be recommended to this client?

© 11 to 20
@ @ 151025
© 25 to 35

© 28 to 40

That's right!

Rationale

A BMI of 26.5 places the client in the overweight category, so the total recommended weight gain is 15 to 25
Ib. A total weight gain of 11 to 20 Ib is recommended for a woman categorized as obese by BMI. A total weight
gain of 25 to 35 |b is recommended for a woman categorized as normal weight by BMI. A total weight gain of
28 to 40 Ib is recommended for a woman categorized as underweight by BMI.

De

What does the Food and Nutrition Board recommend to prevent constipation in toddlers (1

to 3 years old)?
© Decreased dairy consumption

tx} © Increased water intake

@ © 19 of fiber per day

© Increased vegetable and fruit intake

So close!

Rationale

The Food and Nutrition Board recommends 19 g of fiber per day for toddlers to prevent constipation.
Decreasing dairy consumption and increasing the intake of water, vegetables, and fruit are not specifically
recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board to prevent constipation at this age.

p. 186
Question 2
De

At approximately what age are infants ready for the introduction of solid foods?
© 4 months

iv) O 6 months

O 8 months

tx} © 10 months

So close!

Rationale

Age is one of the basic indicators of readiness for solid foods. At approximately 6 months of age, an infant
can have iron-fortified solid foods added to the basic diet of breast milk. Four months is too early to introduce
an infant to iron-fortified solid foods. It is safe for infants to have solid foods prior to 8 and 10 months.

p. 184
Question 3

Which type of nutrition is most beneficial to the newborn?
© Cow's milk

@ © Breast milk
© Human milk fortifier

O Breast milk substitute

That's right!

Rationale

Breast milk is the ideal first food for infants, and it is the primary recommendation of pediatricians and
dietitians. Cow’s milk should never be given to an infant in the first year of life. A human milk fortifier is used
only as a supplement to breast milk. Breast milk substitute is an acceptable alternative to breast milk, but
research has shown that many mothers do not adhere to the recommended safety precautions when
preparing infant formula.

p. 182
Question 4
es

Which statement by the nurse is the most accurate regarding the interpretation of the
growth chart measurements for an infant girl?

© "The percentile will tell us how tall the infant will be as an adult and if there is a potential for obesity
as an adult."

© ©@ "The percentile will help us follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with that of other
infants of her weight and length."

@ © "The percentile will help us follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with that of other infant
girls of her weight and length."

© "The percentile will indicate how long the infant is compared with other healthy and well-nourished
infants of her length and weight."

So close!

Rationale

The statement by the nurse that the percentile will help follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with
that of other infant girls is correct because growth charts allow the health care provider to compare the growth
rate with that of other healthy infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how tall the
infant will be as an adult is incorrect because growth charts do not predict adult height. The statement by the
nurse that the percentile will help to follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with other infants of
her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared with other infants of the same sex, not all
infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how long the infant is compared with
other healthy and well-nourished infants of her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared
with other infants of the same sex, not all infants.
So close!

Rationale

The statement by the nurse that the percentile will help follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with
that of other infant girls is correct because growth charts allow the health care provider to compare the growth
rate with that of other healthy infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how tall the
infant will be as an adult is incorrect because growth charts do not predict adult height. The statement by the
nurse that the percentile will help to follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with other infants of
her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared with other infants of the same sex, not all
infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how long the infant is compared with
other healthy and well-nourished infants of her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared
with other infants of the same sex, not all infants.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words, (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the

material the question asks, and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 175
Question 5
ee

Which growth chart is recommended for plotting height, weight, and head circumference
measurements on an infant boy?

©) World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart
@ @ WHO growth chart for boys
© Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth chart

© CDC growth chart for boys

That's right!

Rationale

The WHO growth chart for boys is the most appropriate growth chart because it is indicated for infant boys
from birth to 2 years old. The WHO growth chart is less appropriate because there are specific growth charts
for boys and girls. The CDC growth chart is incorrect because it is only indicated for children who are older
than 2 years. The CDC growth chart for boys is incorrect because it is only indicated for children who are older
than 2 years.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify an incorrect

answer.

Question 6
ee

Which skill is negatively altered by lead poisoning in children? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [B] Cognitive skill
iv) [ml] Motor skill
tx} [ml] Social skill

© |] Language development skill

tx} [ml] Emotional skill

So close!

Rationale

Lead poisoning in children can be extremely damaging to the central nervous system and can negatively alter
both cognitive and motor skills. Social, language, and emotional skills are not affected by lead poisoning.

p. 191
Question 7

Which eating behavior is common in children age 3 to 5 years?

@ @ Food jags
O Low appetite

© Eating alone
O Distractions during eating

That's right!

Rationale

Food jags are brief sprees or binges of eating one particular food, seen in preschool-aged children and a
frequent source of concern and frustration for caregivers. Low appetite and susceptibility to distractions while
eating are seen in toddlers age 1 to 3 years. Preschool-aged children prefer to eat in groups because eating
becomes a source of socialization. Their food preferences will be reflective of the social group’s likes and
dislikes of various foods.

p. 186
Question 8

At which age does the infant change from a suckling pattern to a mature and stronger suck
with liquids and begin a munching pattern?

O 1 to 3 months

iv) © 4 to 6 months

O 7 to 9 months
O 10 to 12 months

That's right!

Rationale

At 4 to 6 months, the infant changes from a suckling pattern to a mature and stronger suck with liquids and
begins a munching pattern. This change is not observed at 1 to 3 months when rooting and sucking reflexes
are present. At 7 to 9 months, the infant will begin chewing solid foods and will have matured from the simple
munching patterns. At 10 to 12 months, the infant is old enough to reach for spoons, bite nipples, and crunch
foods. This is also beyond the simple munching pattern.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal
the correct answer.

p. 185
Question 9

Which key growth period shows a rise in the levels of growth hormones and sex hormones?
© Adulthood

© Infancy

O Childhood

ivy) © Adolescence

That's right!

Rationale

Levels of growth hormones and sex hormones rise during adolescence. Adulthood is the final phase of a
normal life cycle, during which physical growth plateaus. Rise of growth hormones or sex hormones does not
occur during this period. Infancy refers to the first year of life during which the highest rate of growth of the
entire life cycle occurs. However, sex hormones do not develop during this period. During childhood (between
infancy and adolescence), the growth rate slows and becomes irregular. There is no rise in levels of growth

hormones or sex hormones during this period.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 174
Question 10

A nurse provides nutrition and growth information to parents at their 6-year-old child’s well
visit. Which description matches this child’s nutrition pattern and growth based on the age?

© @ food jags are common during this stage.
@ © ‘Slow and irregular physical growth is typical.
© Appetites usually slow down along with growth rates.

© Eating habits are related to social and emotional experiences.

So close!

Rationale

School-aged children (age 5 to 12 years) have slow and irregular physical growth, but cognitive, emotional,
and social growth are extensive during this developmental state. Food jags are common during the preschool-
aged years (age 3 to 5 years). Appetites usually slow down along with growth rates during the toddler years.
Children continue to form eating patterns, attitudes, and basic eating habits because of social and emotional

experiences involving food during the preschool-aged years.

Test-Taking Tip: Watch for grammatical inconsistencies. If one or more of the options is not grammatically
consistent with the stem, the alert test taker can identify it as a probable incorrect option. When the stem is in

the form of an incomplete sentence, each option should complete the sentence in a grammatically correct

way.

p. 186
Question 11

A nurse teaches a new mother how to safely and properly feed her infant. Which teaching
point would the nurse make about safely feeding the infant formula?

© Warm the formula
@ ©@ Allow milk to fill the nipple while feeding
© Prop the bottle only with supervision

© Allow the infant to have a bottle when sleeping but only after age 6 months

That's right!

Rationale

Safety regarding feeding an infant is important in the discharge planning of new mothers. The nurse would
teach the new mother to tilt the bottle to keep the nipple full of milk, which can prevent the infant from
swallowing air. Formula can be either cold or warm. Caregivers should be discouraged from propping the
bottle. Infants and children should never sleep with a bottle of milk that is capable of pooling in the mouth
because it could lead to tooth decay.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not select answers that contain exceptions to the general rule, controversial material, or

degrading responses.

p. 183
Question 12

Which nutrient is the preferred source of energy for the body during a child’s growth spurt?

That's right!

Rationale

Carbohydrates are the preferred source of energy for the body, particularly for a child experiencing a growth
spurt who needs greater calories to support tissue growth. Fat is a backup energy source and supplies the
essential fatty acids necessary for growth. Protein supports growth instead of providing energy. Calcium is a
necessary nutrient for proper bone growth but does not supply energy to the body.

Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all
options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely. Example: If the answer you are seeking is directed to a
specific treatment and all but one option deal with signs and symptoms, you would be correct in choosing the
treatment-specific option.

p. 179
Question 13

A nurse discusses growth patterns of infants and children with a new mother. During which
two stages is growth the greatest?

© The first year of life and right before adulthood
@ ©@ The first 6 months of life and the onset of puberty

© The onset of puberty and the beginning of adolescence
© The first 6 months of life and the beginning of childhood

That's right!

Rationale

Growth is greatest within the first 6 months of life. The onset of puberty begins the second stage of rapid
growth, which continues into adulthood. Rapid growth occurs within the first year of life, but the greatest
growth occurs during the first 6 months of life. Between infancy and adolescence, the childhood growth rate
slows and becomes irregular.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: If you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about
that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie

diet).

p. 174
Question 14
De

Why do infants require more water per unit of body weight than do adults? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [BB] Infants have a higher metabolic rate.
@ [_| Infants have a larger proportional body surface.
@ |B] A greater percentage of an infant’s total body weight is composed of water.

@ [BB] Infants are more susceptible to volume depletion.

|_| Increased fluid is needed in the infant’s intracellular spaces.

So close!

Rationale

Infants require more water per unit of body weight than adults because they have a higher metabolic rate,
have a larger proportional body surface, have a greater percentage of total body weight composed of water,
and are more susceptible to volume depletion. A larger portion of the increased fluid is needed in the infants’
extracellular, not intracellular, spaces.

p. 179
Question 15

Which is most accurate regarding an infant’s expected rate of growth in the first year of
life?

© Triples birth weight and increases in length by 25%
@ ©@ Triples birth weight and increases in length by 50%

©) Doubles birth weight and increases in length by 25%

©) Doubles birth weight and increases in length by 50%

That's right!

Rationale

During the first year of life, an infant is expected to triple their birth weight and increase in length by 50%.
Tripling their birth weight and increasing in length by 25% is not enough of an increase in length. Doubling
their birth weight and increasing length by 25% is not enough of an increase in weight or length. Doubling
their birth weight and increasing in length by 50% is less than the expected tripling of weight during the first

year of life.

Question 16

Which is a common risk for a toddler who consumes an excessive amount of cow’s milk in
place of meals and snacks?

© Obesity

tx} © Failure to thrive
©) Food insecurity

@ © Iron-deficiency anemia

So close!

Rationale

Although cow’s milk is a source of several important nutrients, it is a poor source of iron. The toddler who
consumes excessive amounts of cow’s milk in place of meals and snacks is at risk for iron-deficiency anemia.
Infants and children are innately capable of recognizing satiety and self-regulating energy balance when
offered a healthy diet, so they are less at risk for obesity. In pediatrics, the term failure to thrive is used to
describe infants, children, or adolescents who do not grow and develop normally. Food insecurity occurs when
there is a limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or there is a limited or

uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.

Question 17

Adolescents have an increased need for calcium to develop bone mass. Which calcium
requirement should the nurse include in an adolescent’s plan of care?

© 800 mg/day
© 1000 mg/day

@ @ 1300 mg/day

© 2000 mg/day

That's right!

Rationale

The recommended calcium requirement for adolescents is 1300 mg/day. Intake below this amount (800
mg/day or 1000 mg/day) would be inadequate. Intake above this amount (2000 mg/day) would be excessive.

Question 18
De

Which stage of growth and development involves irregular periods of growth? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

iv) [| Preschoolers
iv) [| Toddlers

[| Newborns

tx} [ml] Infants

@ |B] School-aged children

So close!

Rationale

Toddlers, preschoolers, and school-aged children experience slow and irregular growth. During these periods,
their energy needs are lower per kilogram of body weight compared with newborns and infants, but they
require well-balanced diets for continued growth and health. Newborns and infants experience rapid, steady
growth.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number response choices by
one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-
option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

Question 19

The premature infant or small-for-gestational-age infant has to overcome which challenge
with feeding? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Poor sucking reflex
@ [B] Small gastric capacity
@ [BB] Difficulty swallowing

[_] Increased intestinal motility

[| Decreased nutrient requirements

That's right!

Rationale

A poor sucking reflex, small gastric capacity, and difficulty swallowing may present challenges in feeding in the
premature infant or small-for-gestational-age infant. The premature infant or small-for-gestational-age infant
is challenged with decreased, not increased, intestinal motility that could present a challenge in feeding. The
premature infant or small-for gestational-age infant is challenged with increased, not decreased, nutrient
requirements for catch-up growth.

Question 20

Which is a negative effect of low-fat cow’s milk to infants younger than 1 year of age? Select
all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[| Excessive vitamin C

@ [BB] Insufficient linoleic acid
|_| Increases the risk for baby-bottle tooth decay
|_| Insufficient consumption of proteins

iv) [ml] Insufficient energy to support growth requirements

That's right!

Rationale

Low-fat cow’s milk does not provide a sufficient amount of linoleic acid, the essential fatty acid found in the
fat portion of milk that is needed for growth and development of body tissues Low-fat and nonfat cow’s milks
do not provide sufficient energy, which results in the infant consuming increased volumes of milk and
excessive protein. Cow’s milk is a poor source of vitamin C, so the infant would not consume excessive vitamin
C. Baby-bottle tooth decay is a result of inappropriate feeding practices, not low-fat milk. Cow’s milk does not
provide sufficient energy to support growth requirements, so the infant would not be able to consume
insufficient volumes of milk and excessive protein.

Question 21

How will the majority of the caloric intake for a 5-year-old child be spent?

O Tissue growth

O Fecal loss

©) Physical activity

ivy) © Basal metabolism

That's right!

Rationale

The majority of the caloric intake for a 5-year-old child is spent on basal metabolism (50%). Tissue growth
accounts for 12%, fecal loss for 8%, and physical activity for 25%.

Question 22

Which two vitamins are recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics as potentially
necessary in supplemental form for infants?

8 ® K and D
O CandA

O Folate and D
O Iron and B

That's right!

Rationale

The two vitamins that are recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics as potentially necessary in
supplemental form for infants are vitamins K and D. Vitamin K is critical for blood clotting; a major
contributor to the daily supply of vitamin K is provided by bacterial production in the gut. Because infants are
born without bacterial flora, their vitamin K synthesis and stores are minimal. There is a concern for a high
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and low levels of vitamin D in breast milk; this is why vitamin D also may
be necessary in supplemental form. Infants are not deficient in vitamins C and A. Pregnant women may
require folate, but infants do not. Infants do not require supplemental iron and vitamin B.

Question 23

Which factor greatly influences an adolescent’s eating pattern? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [B) Rapid growth
iv) [ml] Peer pressure

iv) [ml] Self-consciousness

© |B] Sense of autonomy

[|_| Development of mental capacity

So close!

Rationale

The eating pattern of an adolescent (12 to 18 years old) is greatly influenced by rapid growth as well as by peer
pressure and self-consciousness. The sense of autonomy that occurs in school-aged children (5 to 12 years
old) affects their food choices. The development of mental capacity occurs during the preschool age (3 to 5
years old).

Question 24

Which is the most effective way to avoid an allergic reaction when introducing a new food?

@ © Introducing a new food every 3 to 5 days
© Introducing iron-fortified cereals first
© Avoiding dairy products until 1 year of age
© ©@ Introducing one new food group at a time

So close!

Rationale

The most effective way to avoid an allergic reaction when introducing a new food is to introduce a new food
every 3 to 5 days. lron-fortified cereals are introduced at 6 months of age; iron-fortified cereals made from
rice, barley, or oats should be offered one at a time. Whole-milk yogurt may be introduced at 8 months of age.
Before 1 year of age, cottage cheese, egg yolks, and harder cheeses may be introduced into the infant’s diet.
Introducing one food group at a time will not help identify a specific food that may cause an allergic reaction.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words, (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the

material the question asks, and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

iv) [ml] Low self-esteem

So close!

Rationale

Consequences of childhood obesity includes the psychosocial risk factor of social discrimination and low self-
esteem, as well as a physical risk factor of asthma. Cognitive delay may occur due to a nutritional deficiency,
an environmental exposure, or other risk factors but is not a result of obesity. Physical inactivity is a
contributing behavioral factor for obesity, not a result of it.

p. 190
Question 27

Which category is assigned to an infant whose birth weight, length, and head
circumference are all at or below the 10th percentile for age and sex?

© Appropriate for gestational age
© © Disproportionately small for gestational age
@ © Proportionately small for gestational age
© Large for gestational age

So close!

Rationale

The birth weight, length, and head circumference of infants who are proportionately small for gestational age
are at or below the 10th percentile for age and sex. If the infant’s weight, length, and head circumference are
all within the normal range on a growth chart (i.e., between the 10th and 90th percentiles) relative to the
infant’s gestational age and sex, they are categorized as appropriate for gestational age. If the length and head
circumference are of normal size, but weight is at or below the 10th percentile, the infant is categorized as
disproportionately small for gestational age. Infants whose birth weight is at or above the 90th percentile for
their age and sex are considered large for gestational age.

p. 181
Question 28

Which range matches the energy needs of a child during the first 3 years of life?

@ © 80 to 120 kcal/kg/day
© 110 to 135 kcal/kg/day

© @ 30 to 40 kcal/kg/day
©, 50 to 80 kcal/kg/day

So close!

Rationale

During the first 3 years of life, children need between 80 and 120 kcal/kg/day to support their rapid growth.
The demand for energy, as measured in kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day, is relatively large
throughout infancy and childhood. The energy needs of a premature infant range from 110 to 135

kcal/kg/day. The energy needs of an adult range from 30 to 40 kcal/kg/day, and the energy needs of an
adolescent range from 50 to 80 kcal/kg/day.

Question 29

Which statement reflects nutrition and growth during the adolescent years?
©) Weight and puberty have no relation.

@ © Girls store more subcutaneous fat in the abdominal area.

© ©@ Chronologic age is the best indicator of nutrition needs.

© Late menarche is associated with obesity in adulthood and cardiovascular disease.

So close!

Rationale

During the adolescent years, girls store more subcutaneous fat in the abdominal area, and the pelvis widens
in preparation for future childbearing. Girls who are obese are more likely to progress through puberty at an
earlier age than girls at a normal weight. Because the velocity of growth and onset of puberty can vary greatly,
biologic age is a better indicator of nutrition needs than chronologic age. Early menarche is associated with

adult obesity and increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

Test-Taking Tip: Because few things in life are absolute without exceptions, avoid selecting answers that
include words such as always, never, all, every, and none. Answers containing these key words are rarely correct.

p. 191
Question 30

Which statement is the most accurate regarding the introduction of solid foods to an
infant’s diet?

©) One new food at a time in a large amount, about 5 to 7 days apart
©) One new food at a time in a small amount, about 1 to 2 days apart
@ © One new food at a time in a small amount, about 3 to 5 days apart

© @ One new food at a time in a small amount about 5 to 7 days apart

So close!

Rationale

An infant should be given one new food at a time in small amounts about 3 to 5 days apart; in this way,
adverse reactions can be identified. Giving one new food item at a time in a large amount about 5 to 7 days
apart is incorrect because the food should be given in small amounts and more frequently. Giving one new
food at a time in a small amount about 1 to 2 days apart is too frequent. Giving one new food at a time in
small amounts about 5 to 7 days apart is incorrect because new food can be given more frequently.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details. Details provided in the stem of the item, such as behavioral changes or
clinical changes (or both) within a certain time period, can provide a clue to the most appropriate response or, in
some cases, responses.

Question 31

To support rapid growth during the first 3 years of life, how many kilocalories per kilogram
of body weight are required each day?

©) 50 to 100 kcal/kg

@ © 80 to 120 kcal/kg
©) 100 to 150 kcal/kg

© @ 110 to 135 kcal/kg

So close!

Rationale

To support rapid growth during the first 3 years of life, children need 80 to 120 kcal per kilogram of body
weight per day. For the first 3 years of life, a diet of 50 to 100 kcal/kg daily falls below the nutritional
recommendations, and a diet containing 100 to 150 kcal/kg daily provides more than recommended.

Although the exact needs of a preterm infant are highly variable and not well defined, they are thought to
range from 110 to 135 kcal/kg daily.

p. 175
Question 32

The mother of a 6-month-old infant who is exclusively breastfed asks, "Do | have to give my
baby iron-fortified foods?" Which is the nurse’s most appropriate response?

@ @ “Yes, your baby now requires more iron."
© "If you continue to exclusively breastfeed, you will not have to."
© "Yes, because your baby’s body no longer has iron stores left."

© "No, you can just increase the iron in your diet and continue breastfeeding."

That's right!

Rationale

The iron content of breast milk is highly absorbable and fully meets the needs of an infant for the first 6
months of life. At that point, the infant’s nutrition needs for iron typically exceed that provided exclusively by
breast milk. Therefore the addition of solid foods (e.g., enriched cereal, meat, egg yolks) at approximately 6
months of age and beyond provides additional iron. Breastfeeding alone after age 6 months will not provide
adequate iron. It is not that the baby has no iron stores but that they require more iron than breast milk offers.
Increasing iron in the mother’s diet will not be sufficient for the baby.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p. 180
Question 33

The parent of a preschool-aged child states, "For the past 4 days, my child will eat nothing
but crackers and refuses anything else that | have offered." Which is the nurse’s best
response?

© "Do not give your child any more crackers."

© "Is your child watching too much television?"
@ ©@ “This is normal behavior for a preschool-aged child."

© "lam worried that your child is not eating a balanced diet."

That's right!

Rationale

The best response is "This is normal behavior for a preschool-aged child." A food jag is a brief spree of binging
or eating one particular food. Food jags are not uncommon in the preschool age group (3 to 5 years old). A jag
may last a few days or weeks, and they are usually self-limiting and of no major long-term concern. There is
no need to caution the parent to stop giving the child crackers. Asking if the child is watching too much
television addresses screen time, not diet. There should be no immediate concern that the child is not eating a
balanced diet. A recommendation to continue to offer a variety of foods with the crackers, provide small
portions, and offer frequent nutritious snacks are all appropriate for this child.

p. 186
Question 34

Which factor places an infant at risk for failure to thrive? Select all that apply. One, some,
or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Intestinal obstruction
@ [BB] Diluted ready-to-feed formula

So close!

Rationale

The term failure to thrive in pediatrics is used to describe infants, children, or adolescents who do not grow
and develop normally. Endocrine disease, intestinal obstruction, and dilution of ready-to-feed formula can
place an infant at risk for failure to thrive. Extrusion reflex is the normal early infant reflex to protrude the
tongue outward when it is touched. It disappears at approximately 6 months of age. Failure to thrive can be an
issue if this primitive reflex does not disappear, but it is not a concern in infancy. Genetics is the study of

heredity.

Question 35

Which is the safest method for introducing highly allergenic foods into the diet of infants
and children?

© In the preschool stage
O In regular serving sizes
© In locations other than home

ivy) © After traditional foods have been introduced

That's right!

Rationale

The safest method of introducing highly allergenic foods (e.g., cow’s milk, tree nuts, peanuts) into the diet of
infants and children is to introduce the food as a complementary food once a few traditional first foods have
been tolerated. It is appropriate to introduce highly allergenic foods, which include cow’s milk, wheat, and
other dairy products, during the first year of life; it is unnecessary to wait for preschool. The food should be
introduced in smaller-than-normal amounts so that if an adverse reaction occurs, the offending food can be
easily identified. Introducing highly allergenic foods at home first is safer than doing so at a daycare center or

a restaurant.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 184
Question 36

A preterm infant who consumes breast milk from a milk bank is exposed to which risk?
© Allergic reaction
© Nutrient deficiency
© Protein intake toxicity

ivy) © Necrotizing enterocolitis

That's right!

Rationale

Necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis are the greatest risks to preterm infants who receive breast milk from a
milk bank, though risk is reduced by adding a human milk fortifier to the breast milk. There is no known risk
for allergic reaction to human breast milk from a milk bank. The infant will receive the necessary nutrients
from human milk, and adding a human milk fortifier will provide extra nutrients. There is no risk for protein

toxicity from receiving breast milk from a milk bank.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

Question 37

Which statement is the most accurate regarding an infant who is in the second percentile
for weight-for-length on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) growth chart for infant
girls?

© "The second percentile is at the top of the growth chart, but she is growing as expected."
© "With her measurements, she is on the bottom of the growth chart, but she will keep growing.”
@ ©@ ‘With her measurements, we need to ask more questions to identify any nutrition-related problems."

© "The second percentile is right where she needs to be on the growth chart, and she is growing as
expected.”

That's right!

Rationale

The WHO recommends using the second percentile as a cutoff point, and infants who track this rate of
growth should be screened for potential nutrition-related problems. The statement that the second percentile
is at the top of the growth chart is incorrect because it is toward the bottom of the growth chart, and the
infant is not growing normally compared to other healthy infants. The statement that the second percentile is
on the bottom of the growth chart and the infant will keep growing is not necessarily true, and the infant
should be assessed for potential nutrition-related problems. The statement that the second percentile is right
where the patient needs to be is incorrect because the second percentile is an indication for nutrition-related
problems.

i] School-aged children

So close!

Rationale

Toddlers, preschoolers, and school-aged children experience slow and irregular growth. During these periods,
their energy needs are lower per kilogram of body weight compared with newboms and infants, but they
require well-balanced diets for continued growth and health. Newborns and infants experience rapid, steady
growth.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number response choices by
one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a four-
option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

Question 50

Approximately what percentage of adult peak bone mineral density is deposited during
adolescence?

© 30%
© 0%
© 50%
© 60%

That's right!

Rationale

Approximately 40% of adult peak bone mineral density is deposited during adolescence; 30% is too low, and
50% and 60% are too high.

Question 51

Which factor influences eating habits in school-aged children? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

Bi] Parental food habits

Family meal practices

Group eating

Screen time

Healthy food accessibility

So close!

Rationale

Parental food habits have the most influence on a child’s eating behavior. Much research has focused on the
family meal as an important component to healthy eating, particularly with increasing fruit and vegetable
intake. The amount and type of screen time to which school-aged children are exposed have been correlated
with long-term negative effects on food habits and risks for obesity and insulin resistance. Accessibility to
healthy food also affects the eating habits of school-aged children. Group eating influences the eating habits
of preschool-age children, not school-aged children.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 52

Which factor is an important consideration while formula feeding? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [iil Tilt the bottle to keep the nipple full of milk.

@ Ill Slightly elevate the baby’s head during feeding.

Leave the baby alone to feed with the bottle.

@ [B) Pooling of milk or juice in the mouth can cause tooth decay.

Prop the bottle so the baby can sleep alone at bedtime.

That's right!

Rationale

Tilting the bottle to keep the nipple full of milk can prevent the baby from swallowing air. The baby's head
should be slightly elevated during feeding to facilitate the passage of milk into the stomach. A bottle used as a
pacifier during bedtime causes milk to pool in the mouth, resulting in baby bottle tooth decay. Caregivers
should be encouraged to never prop the bottle or leave the baby alone to feed, especially at bedtime. This will
deprive the baby of the cuddling that is essential for nurturing and will allow milk to pool in the mouth,
leading to choking, earache, or early childhood caries.

Question 53

Which physiologic factor is relevant to feeding premature infants? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

ll] They have a lower body water content.

il] There is less subcutaneous fat to maintain body temperature.

They have poorly calcified bones.

They have strong sucking reflexes.

ll] They have a limited ability for digestion.

i] Their livers lack developed metabolic enzymes.

So close!

Rationale

Premature infants are at risk for impaired growth and nutritional deficiencies because their body systems are
not fully developed. There is little subcutaneous fat to maintain their body temperature. They also have poorly
calcified bones. Digestion is limited in premature infants, and their livers also lack developed metabolic
enzymes. Premature infants have a higher, not lower, body water content. They have weak or absent, not
strong, sucking reflexes owing to incomplete nerve and muscle development.

p. 181
Question 54

Which statement is accurate with regard to breast milk? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

Breast milk is the secondary recommendation by pediatricians as the first food for infants.

The fat content of breast milk changes from the beginning to the end of a single feeding.

The newborn's rooting reflexes help to facilitate breastfeeding.

Breast milk composition changes to meet the needs of the developing child.

Breast milk can be stored in sealed plastic baby bottle liners for later use.

That's right!

Rationale

The fat content of breast milk changes from the beginning to the end of a single feeding. The newborn's
rooting reflexes as well as basic hunger help to facilitate breastfeeding, As the infant grows, breast milk adapts
in composition to match the needs of the developing child. Breast pumps are used by mothers who are away
from their infants for several hours at a time, because breast milk can be stored in sealed plastic baby bottle
liners for later use. Human milk is the primary, not secondary, recommendation by pediatricians as the first
food for infants.

p. 182
Question 55

Which statement made by parents indicates that an infant is ready for solid food to be
introduced into the diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [B “Our infant can hold her head up all on her own."

"Whenever | am preparing her bottle, she reaches for it.”

“When | tried to give her solid food, she pushed the food out of her mouth."

@ [B] "She weighed 8 Ib when she was born, and now she is over 20 Ib."

ll] "When | have tried to feed her solid food, she opens her mouth as | am giving it to her."

So close!

Rationale

The infant who is able to hold their head up demonstrates good head control, a sign of readiness for solid
foods. The infant reaching for food is also a sign of readiness for solid food and eagerness to be fed. A weight
over 20 |b indicates the infant has more than doubled her weight, which is a sign of readiness for solid foods.
The infant opening their mouth when being fed is another a sign of readiness for solid food. The infant
pushing the food out of their mouth means they may not be ready for solid foods; the infant should have
controlled movement of the tongue and be able to swallow solids.

p. 184
Question 56

Which percentile rank does the nurse recognize as a normal progression of growth and
development for an infant who was previously in the 90th percentile for weight-for-length,
who has no medical history, and whose diet is consistent with that recorded during the last
visit?

CO Fifth percentile

CO Second percentile

© 98th percentile

@ © 0th percentile

That's right!

Rationale

In the absence of disease, the infant should continue to grow on the same percentile curve, normally
progressing to the 90th percentile. The fifth percentile is too low; the infant should stay on the 90th percentile
curve with adequate nutrition and in the absence of disease. Because the second and 98th percentiles are
cutoff values indicating nutritional problems, the nurse would not expect a healthy infant’s growth and
development to fall into these ranges.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items
with four options. If you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then
call on your knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p.175
Question 57

An adolescent has a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30. Which health concern would
the nurse discuss with the adolescent and parents? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [Hypertension

Cancer

@ IM Type 2 diabetes

@ I Hyperlipidemia

Bone fractures

Delayed development

That's right!

Rationale
ABM1 over 30 indicates obesity, and an adolescent who is obese is at risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes,

and hyperli fa. Cancer, bone fractures, and delayed development are not directly related to obesity in

adolescents.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the question stem again. Does your choice
answer the question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why," be sure the response you have chosen is
a reason. If the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular; the same goes for plural
question stems and plural responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in
relation to the question stem will reveal the correct answer.

p.190
Question 58

An adolescent asks the nurse if taking a calcium supplement instead of eating and drinking
calcium sources is sufficient. Which is the best response?

© "Calcium supplements are a great way to get your recommended calcium."
© © "Calcium supplements are not recommended."
© "Calcium is not necessary during adolescence."

@ © "Supplemental calcium does not contribute as much to bone density as does dietary calcium."

So close!

Rationale

Supplemental calcium does not contribute as much to bone density as does dietary calcium. Calcium
supplements are not the best way to get recommended calcium. Calcium supplements can be used to
supplement dietary calcium. Calcium intake is required during adolescence.

Test-Taking Tip: Have confidence in your initial response to an item because it more than likely is the correct

answer.

p. 180
Question 59

Which consequence is associated with obesity during childhood? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [By] Metabolic syndrome

Type 1 diabetes

| Asthma

Low self-esteem

Polycystic ovarian syndrome

So close!

Rationale

One of the known consequences of obesity during childhood is metabolic syndrome. Other consequences
include asthma, low self-esteem, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Type 2, not type 1, diabetes is a
consequence of obesity.

Question 60

A nurse is teaching a group of expectant parents about infant nutrition. Which education
point would the nurse make about nutrition safety? Select all the apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Select all that apply

Some correct answers were not selected

Supplement with vitamin D drops if breastfeeding.

Il] Introduce solids when the rooting reflex disappears.

i] Avoid giving water before 6 months of age.

i] Avoid giving honey to an infant younger than 12 months.

Supplement with fluoride beginning at 12 months of age.

So close!

Rationale
Nutrition safety is important education for parents to receive. The nurse would encourage parents to

supplement breastfeeding with daily vitamin D drops, avoid giving water or juice to breastfed infants during

the first 6 months of life, and avoid giving honey to an infant younger than 12 months because of the risk for
botulism spores. Solids should be introduced when the extrusion reflex, not the rooting reflex, disappears
and the ability to swallow solid food is present. A fluoride supplement should be given to infants beginning at
6 months of age if they reside in a community where the fluoride concentration in the water does not exceed
0.3 ppm.

p. 185
Question 61

An infant is born at 35 weeks 4 days and weighs 5 |b 2 oz. Which characteristic of
prematurity alerts the nurse that nutrition requirements will vary for this infant? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

i] Poorly calcified bones

Absence of suck reflex

Limited digestion ability

| Less subcutaneous fat

i] Lack of metabolic enzymes

So close!

Rationale

Premature infants are vulnerable to impaired growth and nutrient deficiencies because their bodies are not yet
fully formed. As a result, they have poorly calcified bones; incomplete nerve and muscle development,
resulting in a weak or absent sucking reflex; limited ability for digestion, absorption, and renal function; little
subcutaneous fat to maintain their body temperature; a lack of metabolic enzymes; and inadequate iron
stores.

p. 181
Question 62

A nurse discusses calcium intake with a parent at the child’s well visit. Which factor is
associated with peak bone mass as an adult? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Genetics

The in utero environment

Dairy allergy as a child

il] Vegetarian diet as a preschooler

i] Ample supply of vitamin D before puberty

So close!

Rationale

Genetics are a strong indicator for peak bone mass as an adult. The in utero environment, such as the
maternal diet, accounts for approximately 20% to 40% of peak bone mass. Good bone density requires an
ample dietary supply of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, protein, and several other nutrients. Dairy foods
provide all of these nutrients and are the main source of calcium for children, so a diet low in dairy due to an
allergy may affect peak bone mass as an adult. A vegetarian diet as a preschooler may affect peak bone mass as
an adult if the diet does not contain adequate calcium and protein.

p.179
Question 63

Which statement explains why infants require more water than do adults? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [By Infants have a higher metabolic rate.

i] Infants have a higher body water content.

Most fluid in an infant’s body is found in intracellular space.

@ [il Infants have a larger proportional body surface area.

The amount of fluid consumed by an infant in 1 day is 10% to 15% of its body weight.

So close!

Rationale

Infants require more water than do adults because they have a larger proportional body surface area, a higher
metabolic rate, and a higher body water content compared with adults. Additionally, an infant consumes an
amount of water each day that is equivalent to 10% to 15% of its body weight, whereas an adult consumes a
daily amount that is equivalent to 2% to 4% of their weight. A large proportion of the infant's total body water
is found in extracellular space.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 64

Using the World Health Organization’s growth chart for infant boys, which infant is most at
risk for nutrition-related problems?
© An 8-month-old boy in the 50th percentile
© A6-month-old boy in the 97th percentile
@ © An 18-month-old boy in the second percentile
© @ A 14-month-old boy in the 25th percentile

So close!

Rationale

The 18-month-old boy in the second percentile is most at risk for nutrition-related problems because the
second percentile, along with the 98th percentile, are the cutoff values indicating nutrition-related problems.
The 8-month-old boy in the 50th percentile is not at risk for nutrition-related problems. The 6-month-old boy
in the 97th percentile is not at risk for nutrition-related problems, nor is the 14-month-old boy in the 25th
percentile.

p.178
Question 65

Which piece of information about an infant’s diet and nutrition would a nurse include in
the education of parents regarding their infant’s first year of life? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

| "You can give your infant whole cow’s milk starting at 6 months."

“Be sure not to give your infant any honey for the first year of life."

|
| “Breastfeeding should be continued for the first 6 months of life."
|

"Solid foods can be introduced when the extrusion reflex disappears."

“Because you are breastfeeding, you don’t need to give your infant water."

| "You should avoid foods like popcorn and grapes until your infant is older."

So close!

Rationale

The parents should not give the infant honey in the first year of life because botulism spores have been
reported in honey, and the immune system of the young infant cannot protect against this infection. The
parents can introduce solid foods when the extrusion reflex disappears because the extrusion reflex disappears
at approximately 6 months of age, and the ability to swallow solid food is established. The parents should
avoid foods like popcorn and grapes because these foods are associated with a high risk for choking and
aspiration and should be delayed until childhood. Whole cow’s milk should not be introduced until the end of
the first year of life. Breastfeeding can be continued for at least the first full year of life. It is only in the first 6

months of infancy that water and juice are unnecessary for breastfed infants.

p. 185
Question 66

If the adolescent weighs 100 Ib, how many kilocalories daily should come from the protein?

Round your answer to one decimal place. | 200 @) 145.6 | kcal

So close!

Rationale

If the patient weighs 100 Ib, then dividing that by 2.2 results in 45.5 kg. To determine the ideal protein intake,
multiply 45.5 kg by 0.8 g/kg, which equals 36.4 g. There are 4 kcal in each gram of protein, so 36.4 g x 4 kcal =
145.6 kcal of protein per day.

p.175
Question 67

What is the ideal protein intake for a healthy adolescent who weighs 120 Ib? Round your

answer to one decimal place. @) 174.7 | 43.6 g

So close!

Rationale

To determine the patient’s weight in kilograms, divide 120 |b by 2.2, which equals 54.5 kg. The nurse
multiplies the weight in kilograms by 0.8 g/kg to determine the recommended intake, so 54.5 kg x 0.8 g/kg =
43.6 g of protein.

Question 68

An 11-year-old child is at the health care provider’s office for a well-child visit. The child’s
body mass index (BMI) percentile is in the 96th percentile. Which condition may be of
consequence due to this BMI percentile? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cancer

lm| Asthma

Liver disease

Hypertension

| Type 2 diabetes

Rationale

Consequences associated with obesity in children and adolescents include asthma, liver disease, hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Cancer has not been associated with childhood and

adolescent obesity.

Question 69

A child is diagnosed with failure to thrive because the child is not eating. Which condition is
a factor in failure to thrive? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Endocrine disease

| Congenital defects

| Intestinal obstruction

Hypermetabolic state

| Emotional deprivation

| Chewing and swallowing problems

So close!

Rationale

Failure to thrive describes infants, children, and adolescents who do not grow and develop normally. Clinical
disease can be a factor in failure to thrive, such as endocrine disease, congenital defects, or intestinal
obstruction. Children who have unusual nutrient needs, such as a hypermetabolic state, which requires
increased dietary intake, can be at risk for failure to thrive. Psychosocial problems, such as a family
environment and relationships resulting in neglect, abuse, or emotional deprivation of the child, can be a
factor in failure to thrive. Neuromotor problems, such as eating, chewing, or swallowing, can be a factor in

failure to thrive.

Question 70

A pediatric nurse is determining the energy requirements to promote rapid growth in a 2-
year-old child weighing 25 |b (11.4 kg). Calculate the minimum number of kilocalories per

day required for the child to grow. Record the answer as a whole number.

@) 200 @) 912 kcal/day

So close!

Rationale

A minimum of 912 kcal/day is required for the growth of a 25-Ib child. During the first 3 years of life, children
need between 80 and 120 kcal/kg/day. To calculate the minimum daily kilocalorie requirement, multiply the
child's weight in kg by 80 kcal/kg/day (80 kcal/kg/day x 11.4 kg = 912 kcal/day). To calculate the maximum
daily kilocalorie requirement, multiply the child's weight by 120 kcal/kg/day (120 kcal/kg/day x 11.4 kg = 1368
kcal/day). The range of calories needed for this child to grow would be 912 to 1368 kcal/day.

months of infancy that water and juice are unnecessary for breastfed infants.

p. 185
Question 82

If the adolescent weighs 100 Ib, how many kilocalories daily should come from the protein?

Round your answer to one decimal place. @) 145.6 __ kcal

That's right!

Rationale

If the patient weighs 100 Ib, then dividing that by 2.2 results in 45.5 kg. To determine the ideal protein intake,
multiply 45.5 kg by 0.8 g/kg, which equals 36.4 g. There are 4 kcal in each gram of protein, so 36.4 g x 4 kcal =
145.6 kcal of protein per day.

p.175
Question 83

What is the ideal protein intake for a healthy adolescent who weighs 120 Ib? Round your

answer to one decimal place. @) 43.6 g

That's right!

Rationale

To determine the patient’s weight in kilograms, divide 120 |b by 2.2, which equals 54.5 kg. The nurse
multiplies the weight in kilograms by 0.8 g/kg to determine the recommended intake, so 54.5 kg x 0.8 g/kg =
43.6 g of protein.

Question 84

An 11-year-old child is at the health care provider’s office for a well-child visit. The child’s
body mass index (BMI) percentile is in the 96th percentile. Which condition may be of
consequence due to this BMI percentile? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

Cancer

Asthma

Liver disease

Hypertension

Type 2 diabetes

Polycystic ovarian syndrome

That's right!

Rationale

Consequences associated with obesity in children and adolescents include asthma, liver disease, hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Cancer has not been associated with childhood and

adolescent obesity.

p. 190
Question 85

What does the Food and Nutrition Board recommend to prevent constipation in toddlers (1
to 3 years old)?

O Decreased dairy consumption
O Increased water intake

rv) © 19 g of fiber per day
O Increased vegetable and fruit intake

That's right!

Rationale

The Food and Nutrition Board recommends 19 g of fiber per day for toddlers to prevent constipation.
Decreasing dairy consumption and increasing the intake of water, vegetables, and fruit are not specifically
recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board to prevent constipation at this age.

p. 186
Question 86

At approximately what age are infants ready for the introduction of solid foods?
© 4 months

Cy) © 6 months
O 8 months
O 10 months

That's right!

Rationale

Age is one of the basic indicators of readiness for solid foods. At approximately 6 months of age, an infant
can have iron-fortified solid foods added to the basic diet of breast milk. Four months is too early to introduce
an infant to iron-fortified solid foods. It is safe for infants to have solid foods prior to 8 and 10 months.

p. 184
Question 87

Which statement by the nurse is the most accurate regarding the interpretation of the
growth chart measurements for an infant girl?

"The percentile will tell us how tall the infant will be as an adult and if there is a potential for obesity
as an adult."

"The percentile will help us follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with that of other
infants of her weight and length."

QO ©@ “The percentile will help us follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with that of other infant
girls of her weight and length."

"The percentile will indicate how long the infant is compared with other healthy and well-nourished
infants of her length and weight."

That's right!

Rationale

The statement by the nurse that the percentile will help follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with
that of other infant girls is correct because growth charts allow the health care provider to compare the growth
rate with that of other healthy infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how tall the
infant will be as an adult is incorrect because growth charts do not predict adult height. The statement by the
nurse that the percentile will help to follow the infant’s physical growth rate compared with other infants of
her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared with other infants of the same sex, not all
infants. The statement by the nurse that the percentile will indicate how long the infant is compared with
other healthy and well-nourished infants of her weight and length is incorrect because the infant is compared

with other infants of the same sex, not all infants.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words, (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the
material the question asks, and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p.175
Question 88

Which skill is negatively altered by lead poisoning in children? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

| Cognitive skill

Motor skill

Social skill

Language development skill

Emotional skill

So close!

Rationale

Lead poisoning in children can be extremely damaging to the central nervous system and can negatively alter
both cognitive and motor skills. Social, language, and emotional skills are not affected by lead poisoning.

p. 191
Question 89

A nurse provides nutrition and growth information to parents at their 6-year-old child’s well

visit. Which description matches this child’s nutrition pattern and growth based on the age?
x) © Food jags are common during this stage.

rv) O Slow and irregular physical growth is typical.
O Appetites usually slow down along with growth rates.

O Eating habits are related to social and emotional experiences.

So close!

Rationale

School-aged children (age 5 to 12 years) have slow and irregular physical growth, but cognitive, emotional,
and social growth are extensive during this developmental state. Food jags are common during the preschool-
aged years (age 3 to 5 years). Appetites usually slow down along with growth rates during the toddler years.
Children continue to form eating patterns, attitudes, and basic eating habits because of social and emotional

experiences involving food during the preschool-aged years.

Test-Taking Tip: Watch for grammatical inconsistencies. If one or more of the options is not grammatically
consistent with the stem, the alert test taker can identify it as a probable incorrect option. When the stem is in

the form of an incomplete sentence, each option should complete the sentence in a grammatically correct

way.

p. 186
Question 90

Why do infants require more water per unit of body weight than do adults? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Infants have a higher metabolic rate.

nfants have a larger proportional body surface.

a
m| A greater percentage of an infant’s total body weight is composed of water.
a

nfants are more susceptible to volume depletion.

ncreased fluid is needed in the infant’s intracellular spaces.

That's right!

Rationale

Infants require more water per unit of body weight than adults because they have a higher metabolic rate,
have a larger proportional body surface, have a greater percentage of total body weight composed of water,
and are more susceptible to volume depletion. A larger portion of the increased fluid is needed in the infants’

extracellular, not intracellular, spaces.

p. 179
Question 91

To support rapid growth during the first 3 years of life, how many kilocalories per kilogram
of body weight are required each day?

O 50 to 100 kcal/kg
rv) © 80 to 120 kcal/kg

O 100 to 150 kcal/kg

O 110 to 135 kcal/kg

That's right!

Rationale

To support rapid growth during the first 3 years of life, children need 80 to 120 kcal per kilogram of body
weight per day. For the first 3 years of life, a diet of 50 to 100 kcal/kg daily falls below the nutritional
recommendations, and a diet containing 100 to 150 kcal/kg daily provides more than recommended.
Although the exact needs of a preterm infant are highly variable and not well defined, they are thought to
range from 110 to 135 kcal/kg daily.

Question 1
—

What is the advantage of using the mini nutritional assessment (MNA) to assess the

nutritional status in older adults in nursing homes?

O It diagnoses malnutrition.
O It can be used anywhere.
O It assesses dietary intake.

rv) © It evaluates the risk for malnutrition.

That's right!

Rationale

The MNA is a highly reliable tool that is used to evaluate risk for malnutrition in older adults residing in
nursing homes. The MNA is not used to diagnose malnutrition; rather, it is used in the nursing home setting,
not anywhere, and it does not just specifically assess dietary intake. It assesses other parameters that can
identify risk factors for malnutrition.

p. 202
Question 2
—

Which age is forecasted to be the median in the United States by the year 2060?
© 18 years
© 38 years

@ © 43 years

© @ 65 years

So close!

Rationale

The median age will increase from 38 to 43 by 2060, with women outnumbering men in the eldest groups.

Eighteen, 38, and 65 are not the forecasted average median age of the U.S. population by the year 2060.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect, and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question
that requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a

problem, read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 195
Question 3
a

Which physiologic change in older adults results in the risk for a nutritional deficiency of
vitamin B 43?

O Poor nutrition

O Decline in insulin production

©) Decreased metabolism

rv) © Decreased hydrochloric acid

That's right!

Rationale

As people age, the production and secretion of hydrochloric acid decreases and may result in inadequate
vitamin B 39 absorption. Poor nutrition is not a physiologic change. During the aging process, the common
decline in insulin production or insulin sensitivity may result in elevated blood glucose levels and diabetes.
Decreased metabolism is a naturally occurring process in aging that is responsible for reduced cell
metabolism and changes in body composition.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 201
Question 4

Which factor governs the overall physical growth and maturity of the human body?
© Personality development

O Marriage

@ ©@ Genetic potential

© Family income

That's right!

Rationale

Genetic potential is one of the factors that govern the overall physical growth and maturity of the human
body, which level off during the early adult years. Personality development and marriage influence
psychosocial development, not the physical growth, of an individual throughout adult years. Family income

influences socioeconomic status, not the physical growth, of an individual during adult years.

p. 198
Question 5

The Healthy People initiative website focuses on which topic?
© Healthy aging

@ ©@ Quility of life
© Diet and exercise

© Nutritional products

That's right!

Rationale
The major focus of the Healthy People initiative is quality of life. The website includes information on healthy

aging, diet, and exercise but does not sell products.

p. 195
Question 6

Which meal program is most appropriate for a physically active older adult who is

socioeconomically stable?
© Home-delivered meals

rv) © Congregate nutrition services
O Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

O Commodity supplemental food program

That's right!

Rationale

Congregate nutrition services are most appropriate for a physically active older adult who is socioeconomically
stable. Socioeconomic stability does not impact the ability to participate in the nutrition program. It is a
service that provides adults who are older than 60 years of age and their spouses with nutritionally sound
meals in senior centers and other public or private facilities. Home-delivered meals are for older adults who
are ill or disabled and cannot travel to the community centers. SNAP issues benefits to any primary head of
household at or below 130% of the federal poverty line. The commodity supplemental food program is for
individuals older than 60 years of age who are at a socioeconomic disadvantage. The program is intended to
provide food packages to supplement a diet with foods that are high in nutrition.

p. 207
Question 7

Which dietary change is important for individuals as they age to help address a declining
metabolic rate?

O The diet should include supplemental vitamin B j2.
rv) © The intake of "empty calorie" foods should decrease.
O Carbohydrates should only comprise 25% to 40% of total kilocalories.

O Consumption of foods fortified with vitamin D should increase.

That's right!

Rationale

Consumption of "empty calorie" foods should be decreased to help address the decline in the metabolic rate
and avoid obesity and other health issues. The need for supplementation with vitamin B 19 is caused by
reduced hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, not a change in metabolic rate. Carbohydrates should comprise
approximately 45% to 60% of total kilocalories. An increased need for vitamin D as one ages is caused by

decreased synthesis, not a change in the metabolic rate.

p. 200
Question &

Which macronutrient need is higher per kilogram of body weight for adults 65 years and

older as a result of a decreased metabolic rate and sarcopenia?

O Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale

Decreased metabolic performance and sarcopenia lead to a need for higher per kilogram levels of protein in
older adults. There is not a higher per kilogram of body weight need for fats, calcium, or carbohydrates;

metabolic performance and sarcopenia do not address these nutrients in the same way.

p. 200
Question 9

What common condition in older adults interferes with the ability to prepare food?

O Sarcopenia
Cy) © Decreased hand function

O Chronic illness

©) Decreased hand-eye coordination

That's right!

Rationale

Decreased hand function is a common condition in older adults and may interfere with the ability to prepare
food. Sarcopenia is a loss of lean tissue mass related to aging. Not all chronic illnesses result in an older
adult’s inability to prepare food. Decreased hand-eye coordination occurs as a result of the overall decreased
hand function and by itself is not considered a common condition.

Test-Taking Tip: Have confidence in your initial response to an item because it more than likely is the correct

answer.

p. 200
Question 10

Which food/nutrient can cause an adverse reaction in an older adult client taking a

nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)?

rv) O Alcohol
x) © Grapefruit juice
O Licorice

O Caffeine

So close!

Rationale

Alcohol should be avoided for the older adult client taking an NSAID. Grapefruit juice should be avoided for a
client taking antihyperlipidemics and antihistamines. Licorice should be avoided for a client taking
antihypertensives. Caffeine should be avoided for clients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

p. 206
Question 11

How can a decrease in hypothalamic function adversely affect an older adult client?

© Increases skeletal muscle loss
@ © [Increases the risk for dehydration
© ©@ Promotes unintentional weight gain

© Increases the risk for osteoporosis

So close!

Rationale

The decrease in hypothalamic function reduces thirst in older adults, which results in an increased risk for
dehydration. An increased loss of skeletal muscle mass occurs as a result of inadequate dietary protein
metabolism and physical activity. Unintentional weight gain results from nutritional problems. The increased
risk for osteoporosis occurs significantly with age and is a result of poor bone health. Some contributing

factors include inadequate vitamin D and calcium intake.

p. 202
Question 12

For which health issue is the older adult client who experiences a decline in taste and smell
acuity at the highest risk?

rv) © Food-borne illness

O Frequent illness
O Poor bone health

O Unintentional weight loss

That's right!

Rationale

The older adult client who experiences a decline in taste and smell acuity is at the greatest risk for food-borne
illness because the client may be unable to recognize spoiled food. Frequent illnesses in the older adult are a
result of malnourishment rather than the effects of aging. Poor bone health occurs when bone mineral
density is low and bones become brittle. Many factors contribute to poor bone health, including inadequate
calcium and vitamin D intake, which are not related to a decline in taste and smell acuity. Unintentional
weight loss may be a sign of malnutrition or another disease process that is not necessarily caused by a

decline in taste and smell acuity.

p. 201
Question 13

What is the most effective way that a health care team can advocate for an older adult who
is at risk for malnutrition and eligible for nutritional assistance?

O Set up transportation.
O Counsel the client’s family.
rv) © Assist in the application process.

O Contact a community center.

That's right!

Rationale

A health care team can advocate for an older adult who is at risk for malnutrition by assisting in the
application process for nutritional assistance and helping set up the older adult’s involvement so they can
receive adequate nutrition. Setting up transportation will not help the older adult client at a socioeconomic
disadvantage to purchase food. Counseling the family and consulting a community center are not as effective
options as helping with the application for ensuring the client receives adequate nutritional assistance.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 207
Question 14

Which statement best reflects the physical changes that may lead to a need for vitamin B 2
injections?

O Older adults often do not eat very well and need supplementation of all vitamins, including vitamin B
12-

@ © Vitamin B 12 may not be absorbed adequately because of decreased production and secretion of
gastric hydrochloric acid.

© Many older adults do not spend much time in the sun, which leads to decreased absorption of
vitamin B 42 and other vitamins.

© Over the age of 50 years, people must use oral vitamin B ,2 supplements or they will eventually
require vitamin B 49 injections.

That's right!

Rationale

There is a high risk for deficiency of vitamin B j2 as individuals age as a result of decreased gastric acid
production and secretion decreasing absorption of the vitamin. Physical changes may alter food intake of
older adults leading to micronutrient deficiencies, but this does not provide the best explanation for the need
for vitamin B 2 injections for this client. Lack of sunlight affects vitamin D, not vitamin B 12. Foods fortified
with vitamin B 1) or vitamin B j2 supplementation should be used by individuals over age 50 years, but this
response does not provide an explanation for the physical changes that result in a need for vitamin B j2
injections.

p. 201
Question 15
|

As the nurse begins to create a care plan to assess physical changes that may impact
nutrition for an older adult client, which question should the nurse include during the

assessment process? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B] "Have you noticed any changes in thirst?"

| “Has your sense of taste and smell decreased>"

“Are you experiencing issues with your hearing?"

lm] “How many times a night do you need to get up and use the bathroom:"

@ |B] “Are you having difficulty chopping and preparing the food?"

So close!

Rationale

Physical changes of aging, including decreased thirst, sense of taste and smell, and hand function, can all
create issues related to food patterns, ultimately affecting nutrition. Decreased hearing and frequent trips to
the bathroom can also occur as a person ages but are not directly implicated in changes in nutrition.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 200
Question 16

Which factor contributes to sarcopenia? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

rv) | Inadequate dietary protein metabolism

Decrease in level of melatonin

rv) m| Inadequate physical activity

Osteoporosis

High-quality dietary fat

That's right!

Rationale

Sarcopenia is the loss of lean tissue mass associated with aging. The contributing factors to sarcopenia
include inadequate dietary protein metabolism and inadequate physical activity. Decrease in level of
melatonin, osteoporosis, and high-quality dietary fat are not factors that contribute to sarcopenia.

p. 199
Question 17

Personal psychosocial growth progresses through which years? Select all that apply.One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

m| Young

Older

Middle

Infancy

Childhood

So close!

Rationale

There are three unique stages of personal psychosocial growth that progress through the young, middle, and
older years. Infancy and childhood are not identified as unique stages.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 198
Question 18

Which change does the U.S. Census Bureau predict regarding future demographics of the
U.S. population?
O Median age will increase from 28 to 38 years.

rv) O Women will outnumber men in the eldest groups.
O Growth rates for various ethnic subgroups will decrease.

x) © Adults over 65 years will outnumber young adults over 18.

So close!

Rationale

The U.S. Census Bureau forecasts that older women will outnumber older men by the year 2035. The median
age will increase from 38 to 43 years; older adults over 65 years will outnumber children under 18 years, not
over 18; and the growth rate of ethnic groups will increase, not decrease.

p. 195
Question 19

Which program is available for low-income older adults to help improve nutrition by

increasing their servings of fruits and vegetables?
O U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

rv) O Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program
O Meals on Wheels

x) © Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

So close!

Rationale

The Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program is a grant-based program available for low-income older
adults; it provides coupons that participants can exchange for fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs at farmers’
markets, community-supported agriculture programs, and roadside stands. The program has increased the
average servings of fruits and vegetables among participants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services provides essential services to help enhance and protect the well-being of all Americans. Meals on
Wheels is an organization that delivers meals to the homes of older adults who are ill or disabled. SNAP issues
electronic benefits transfer cards to the primary caregiver in the household. The electronic cards are used to
purchase eligible food items at authorized food retail outlets.

p. 208
Question 20

Once an individual reaches early adulthood, which best reflects the process of physical
growth?

O Physical growth is completed by adulthood and begins a slow decline.
O Physical growth is genetically predetermined and stops after adolescence.
rv) O The physical growth process involves the vital growth of new cells to replace old cells.

x) © Physical growth continues throughout life and requires an increasing number of cells.

So close!

Rationale

Physical growth and maturity levels off during the early adult years, and physical growth becomes a process of
vital growth of new cells rather than increasing numbers of cells for growth and development. Physical growth
and maturity are governed by genetic potential and level off in the early adult years; it is not complete at
adulthood, nor does it stop at the end of adolescence. Physical growth in adulthood is about growth of new
cells to replace old cells, not increasing numbers of cells.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 198
Question 21

The nurse is assessing an older adult client admitted for assessment and treatment of
unexplained weight loss. Which question would be most important for the nurse to include

in the assessment to understand what may have led to the unexplained weight loss?

© "Have you had trouble paying your rent and buying food?"
© "Have you noticed that you cannot taste or smell your food recently?"
© "Have you thought about trying to exercise to increase your appetite?"

@ ©@ "Have you had feelings of overwhelming sadness or loneliness recently?"

That's right!

Rationale

Depression is a common psychiatric condition seen in older adults and the leading cause of unintentional
weight loss, so asking the client about overwhelming loneliness and sadness, which can indicate depression,
would be most important. Asking about the ability to afford rent and food may be helpful but would not be
the most important question to ask in determining the cause of the weight loss. Sensory changes including
taste and smell can contribute to a poor appetite but would not be the most important in determining the
cause of the unintentional weight loss. Asking whether the client has thought about exercising to help
increase appetite would not elicit information to determine the possible cause of the unintentional weight
loss.

p. 198
Question 22

Which statement provides the most accurate information about metabolic changes related
to aging in men and women?

rv) O Basal metabolic rate declines for both sexes with a more rapid decline beginning earlier for men than
for women.

© There are no real sex differences when it comes to declines in basal metabolic rate; an average of 1%
to 2% per decade is normal.

© @ The basal metabolic rate generally declines more rapidly for women, which is why women tend to
gain weight more easily with age.

© The basal metabolic rate declines similarly for men and women with an estimated 5% decrease in
metabolic activity during the middle and older years.

So close!

Rationale

Basal metabolic rate declines 1% to 2% per decade, with a more rapid decline beginning at age 40 for men
and age 50 for women. Basal metabolic rate does decline 1% to 2% per decade, but an increased rate of
decline begins earlier for men than women, so this is an incorrect statement. The basal metabolic rate begins
a more rapid decline for men at age 40 and women at age 50, so stating that the rate declines more rapidly for
women is incorrect. The basal metabolic rate does decline an estimated 5% overall during the middle and
older years, but there is a more rapid decline that begins earlier for men than women, so this statement does

not best respond to the question.

p. 200
Question 23

Which statement best explains the recommendation for increased physical activity as
individuals age?

O Even though increased physical activity will not impact metabolic rate, it will help increase muscle
mass.

@ @ Changes in the metabolic rate lead to lean muscle mass loss; increased physical activity can help
maintain muscle mass and maintain the metabolic rate.

As individuals age, they lose muscle mass caused by a decreased metabolic rate. Although this cannot
be changed, increased exercise will help individuals feel better overall.

© The metabolic rate declines steadily beginning at age 20 years, so greater amounts of exercise are
needed to increase the metabolic rate and maintain muscle mass.

That's right!

Rationale

Changes in the metabolic rate lead to loss of lean muscle mass; regular physical activity can help maintain
muscle mass and the metabolic rate as well. Increased physical activity can help maintain the metabolic rate.
Increased physical activity can help maintain muscle mass and the metabolic rate; it is not impossible to

change. The metabolic rate begins to decline around age 30 years, not 20 years.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) Determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are

incorrect.

p. 199
Question 24

What is the most effective way for the nurse to assist with the feeding of an older adult

client? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Alternate foods after each bite.

Provide liquids at the end of the meal.

| Identify the food that is being served.

Remain focused on the client.

m| Encourage the client by stating "Eat this because it is good for you."

So close!

Rationale

The most effective way for the nurse to assist with feeding an older adult is to identify the food that is being
served and remain focused on the client. Foods should not be switched after every bite. The client should have
at least three bites of the same food before going to another food to allow time for the taste buds to become
accustomed to the food. Liquids should be given throughout the meal and not just at the beginning or end of
the meal. The statement "Eat this because it is good for you" has little value for anyone, especially for those
who are struggling to maintain their personal integrity and self-esteem in a youth-oriented, age-fearing
culture.

p. 202
Question 25

What is the most therapeutic statement a nurse can make when introducing healthy new
foods into the diet of an older adult client with feeding problems?
O "| know this looks funny, but just give it a try."

O “Eat this; it is so good for you."
rv) © "| have added a new food today."

O "| put some seasoning on it so it tastes better."

That's right!

Rationale

New foods should be introduced with familiar comfort foods. "| have added a new food today" is the most
therapeutic statement that the nurse can make. Saying "I know this looks funny, but just give it a try" is a
negative remark about the food. "Eat this; it is so good for you" has little value, especially if the client is
struggling to maintain personal integrity and self-esteem. "| have put some seasoning on it so it tastes better"
is a negative statement about the food, and the nurse should only introduce seasoning if the client requests it.

p. 202
Question 26

When assessing the nutritional status of the older adult, which potential nutritional
problem should be the nurse’s priority concern?
O Physical activity

O Overeating

O Decreased absorption of nutrients
rv) © Insufficient nourishment

That's right!

Rationale

A lack of sufficient nourishment is a primary nutrition problem for older adults. Physical activity is not a
nutritional problem, but a lack of it can lead to unnecessary weight gain. Overeating can lead to obesity, which
is on the rise, but it is not as common a problem in the older adult. The gastrointestinal muscles do weaken,

which contributes to the decreased absorption and bioavailability of nutrients, but this is a lower-priority
concern in the nurse’s assessment.

p. 200
Question 27

Which entity provides cash and/or commodities to supplement meals offered at congregate
and home-delivered nutrition programs?

rv) © Nutrition Service Incentive Program
O U.S. Department of Agriculture
O Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

O Administration on Aging of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

That's right!

Rationale

The Nutrition Service Incentive Program provides cash and/or commodities to supplement meals offered at
congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides research
and services to older adults. SNAP issues electronic benefits transfer cards to the primary caregiver in the
household. The electronic cards are used to purchase eligible food items. The Administration on Aging of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services carries out the provisions of the Older Americans Act.

Question 28

Which physiologic change contributes to the development of dehydration in an older adult?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Diminishing kidney function

Osteopenia and osteoporosis

rv) m| Changes in the hypothalamus

Declining gastrointestinal motility

Decreased enzyme and mucus secretion in the intestines

That's right!

Rationale
Diminishing kidney function may increase body fluid loss, and changes in the hypothalamus can lead to
decreased thirst sensation. Osteopenia and osteoporosis, declining gastrointestinal motility, and decreased

enzyme and mucus secretion also occur with aging but are not implicated in dehydration.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 202
Question 29

Which factor contributes to poor bone health for all populations? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

| Inadequate calcium intake

| Inadequate vitamin D intake

Smoking

Increased estrogen level after menopause in women

m| Thin body frame

| The use of medications that alter mineral bioavailability

That's right!

Rationale

Inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is known to be associated with poor bone health. Use of
substances such as tobacco and alcohol are also known to cause poor bone health. A thin body frame and the
use of medications that alter mineral bioavailability may also contribute to poor bone health. Increased
estrogen levels are also not associated with poor bone health; decreased estrogen levels occur after
menopause and contribute to poor bone health.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 201
Question 30

Which component of the aging process may cause insomnia in an older patient?

© Less physical exercise
Cy) © Decrease in melatonin

O Reduced cell metabolism

© Cessation of estrogen production

That's right!

Rationale
In the aging process, decreases in the level of melatonin production may interfere with normal sleep cycles.
Less physical exercise, reduced cell metabolism, and cessation of estrogen production all occur with aging but

do not interfere with the sleep cycle.

p. 199
Question 31

After taking a health history and consulting the dietary reference intake (DRI) for a 62-year-
old patient, which recommendation may be indicated as a result of a decrease in gastric

acid production related to the aging process?

@ © Vitamin B 12 supplements

© Monitoring glucose levels
© lactose-free dairy products

© Levothyroxine supplements

That's right!

Rationale

Gastric mucosal cells secrete hydrochloric acid, which is necessary for vitamin B 12 digestion; however, as
people age, the production and secretion of hydrochloric acid often decrease and may result in inadequate
vitamin B j9 absorption. The DRI specifies that individuals who are 50 years old or older should consume
vitamin B j) in supplemental form or through subcutaneous vitamin B 39 injections, which bypass the
digestive tract and are not dependent on such factors for absorption. Glucose levels, lactose-free dairy
products, and levothyroxine supplements are not indicated for this patient.

p. 201
Question 32

An older patient being seen in a community clinic is noted to have a body mass index (BMI)
of 30. After ascertaining dietary habits and income information, which program does the
nurse recommend?

O Meals on Wheels
tx} © Congregate nutrition services
O Human Nutrition Research Center

@ © Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

So close!

Rationale
A BMI of 30 indicates obesity. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides nutrition

education and obesity prevention interventions. Meals on Wheels and congregate nutrition services provide
low-cost meals but not interventions and education clearly needed by this patient. The Human Nutrition
Research Center is a research facility that does not provide direct patient services.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 207
Question 33

As the nurse begins to create a care plan to assess physical changes that may impact
nutrition for an older adult client, which question should the nurse include during the

assessment process? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B] "Have you noticed any changes in thirst?"

Cy) | “Has your sense of taste and smell decreased>"

“Are you experiencing issues with your hearing?"

@ |B] “Are you having difficulty chopping and preparing the food?"

"How many times a night do you need to get up and use the bathroom?"

That's right!

Rationale

Physical changes of aging, including decreased thirst, sense of taste and smell, and hand function, can all
create issues related to food patterns, ultimately affecting nutrition. Decreased hearing and frequent trips to
the bathroom can also occur as a person ages but are not directly implicated in changes in nutrition.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 200
Question 34

Personal psychosocial growth progresses through which years? Select all that apply.One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Young
rv) mw] Older

@ IB] Middle

Infancy

Childhood

That's right!

Rationale

There are three unique stages of personal psychosocial growth that progress through the young, middle, and
older years. Infancy and childhood are not identified as unique stages.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the

material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 198
Question 35

Which change does the U.S. Census Bureau predict regarding future demographics of the
U.S. population?
O Median age will increase from 28 to 38 years.

rv) © Women will outnumber men in the eldest groups.
O Growth rates for various ethnic subgroups will decrease.

O Adults over 65 years will outnumber young adults over 18.

That's right!

Rationale

The U.S. Census Bureau forecasts that older women will outnumber older men by the year 2035. The median
age will increase from 38 to 43 years; older adults over 65 years will outnumber children under 18 years, not

over 18; and the growth rate of ethnic groups will increase, not decrease.

p. 195
Question 36

Which program is available for low-income older adults to help improve nutrition by
increasing their servings of fruits and vegetables?

O U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
rv) © Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program
O Meals on Wheels

O Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

That's right!

Rationale

The Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program is a grant-based program available for low-income older
adults; it provides coupons that participants can exchange for fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs at farmers’
markets, community-supported agriculture programs, and roadside stands. The program has increased the
average servings of fruits and vegetables among participants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services provides essential services to help enhance and protect the well-being of all Americans. Meals on
Wheels is an organization that delivers meals to the homes of older adults who are ill or disabled. SNAP issues
electronic benefits transfer cards to the primary caregiver in the household. The electronic cards are used to
purchase eligible food items at authorized food retail outlets.

p. 208
Question 37

How can the use of multiple medications adversely affect nutrition in older adults? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Turns supplements toxic

Alters fluid balance

a
| Affects appetite
a

Inhibits absorption of nutrients

Changes disease symptoms

So close!

Rationale

Taking multiple medications is known as polypharmacy. Polypharmacy can adversely affect the overall
nutritional status by altering the client’s fluid balance, affecting appetite, and inhibiting absorption of
nutrients. Although different medications may have adverse interactions with certain supplements,
polypharmacy itself does not necessarily cause supplement toxicity. The drugs are meant to reduce disease
symptoms; this does not necessarily affect nutrition.

p. 206
Question 38

Which recommendation would be made for a patient who scores 14 points on the Mini

Nutritional Assessment?
x) © Nutritional counseling

O Close weight monitoring
rv) O Rescreen after an illness

O Oral nutritional supplementation

So close!

Rationale

A screening score on the Mini Nutritional Assessment of 14 indicates a normal nutritional status and the
patient should be rescreened yearly or after an illness or an acute event. Close weight monitoring, nutritional
counseling, or oral nutritional supplementation are for those at risk or who are malnourished with scores

above 14 points.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be
wrong and lose precious points.

p. 204
Question 39

The nurse is completing a mini nutritional assessment (MNA) on the client. How would the
nurse score a client who has a moderate decrease in food consumption but no weight loss
in the past 3 months; is able to fairly independently leave the home; suffers from mild

dementia; has suffered the loss of a spouse one month ago; and has a body mass index of

20.5? Record your answer using a whole number. @) 3

8

So close!

Rationale

According to the MNA, a score of 1 would be assigned to the moderate decrease in food consumption, a score
of 3 for no weight loss in the past 3 months, a score of 2 for the ability to independently leave the home, a
score of 1 for the mild dementia, a score of 0 because of recent loss (within 3 months) of spouse, and a score
of 1 for a body mass index of 20.5, which totals 8. A score of 8 places the individual at risk for malnutrition.

p. 203

Question 40

An older resident of a nursing home presents to the office with symptoms that include

depression and bone pain. Which condition would the nurse suspect?

O Sarcopenia
O Senescence

O Onset of dementia

rv) © Vitamin D deficiency

That's right!

Rationale
Living in a nursing home with too little sunlight along with the aging process are risk factors for vitamin D

deficiency. Symptoms include depression, muscle weakness, and bone pain. The symptoms do not point to
sarcopenia, senescence, or dementia

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 201
Question 41

Which change related to aging increases the risk potential for foodborne illness in the

elderly population? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

x) ™| Senescence

Osteoporosis

rv) m| Loss of sensory acuity

rv) m| Impaired physical coordination

Decreased gastrointestinal motility

So close!

Rationale

The risk for foodborne illness increases in older individuals as they begin to lose eyesight, taste, and smell
acuity, and as they lose the ability to identify spoiled food. Impaired physical coordination also makes safe
preparation of food difficult because inadequate chopping and cutting can pose a dangerous health risk.
Senescence is the normal process of aging that is not a risk for foodborne illness. Osteoporosis increases a
patient's risk for fractures but not foodborne illness. Decreased gastrointestinal motility can cause constipation

and nausea, but is not a risk for foodborne illness.

p. 201
Question 42

Which factor contributes to poor bone health in an older patient? Select all that apply.One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Smoking
rv) | Menopause

rv) ml Lack of calcium

Excess exercise

Large body frame

That's right!

Rationale

Poor bone health can be caused by smoking, inadequate calcium intake, reduction of estrogen after
menopause, and other issues. Lack of exercise, not an excess, and a small, not large, body frame are also

factors in poor bone health.

p. 201
Question 43

The family of an older adult client contacts the primary care provider regarding concerns
about the client’s weight loss over the past 8 months. They report that the client does not
need to lose weight and has not been trying to do so. If the client weighed 160 Ib 8 months

ago, which current weight supports a diagnosis of unintentional weight loss?

0 ® 152

That's right!

Rationale

Unintentional weight loss is defined as a weight loss of 5% of body weight over 6 months to a year that was
not intentional; a weight of 152 lb meets the criteria. A weight of 153 |b is approximately 4% and does not
meet the criteria. A weight of 156 |b is approximately 3% and does not meet the criteria. A weight of 157 Ib is

approximately 2% and does not meet the criteria.

p. 198
Question 44

Which food should be avoided when taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Salami

Cy) | Cheese

Tuna

Milk

Cy) Tofu

So close!

Rationale

The older adult client taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor should avoid tyramine-containing foods such as

cheese, cured meats, and soy products; tyramine can cause adverse effects. Milk and tuna do not contain

tyramine.

p. 206
Question 45

Which factor most commonly contributes to depression in the older adult? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Loneliness

| Poor health

iv)
rv) m| Mortality
iv)

Aging

| Increased cost of health care

That's right!

Rationale

Feelings of loneliness, mortality, poor health, and the increased cost of health care are closely related to
depression in the older adult. Depression is a clinical syndrome that is not part of the normal aging process.

p. 198
Question 46

Which factor can contribute to malnutrition in the older adult? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

| Economic insecurity

Dentures

|
| Social isolation
|

Decreased gastric motility

Increased hydrochloric acid secretion

So close!

Rationale

Factors that contribute to malnutrition in the older adult include economic insecurity, social isolation, and
decreased gastric motility. Dentures do not contribute to malnutrition in the older adult unless they are ill-
fitting. Hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach is decreased, not increased, with age.

p. 202
Question 47

A 45-year-old adult who is having difficulty keeping weight off asks the nurse at the primary
care provider’s office why it is so difficult to keep weight off and stay toned despite 50
minutes of moderate-intensity activity three times a week. Which response by the nurse

provides the best explanation to the client?

O "Insulin sensitivity and production both decline, making it harder to stay toned and keep off weight."

O "Dietary needs change, so you must focus on different sources of carbohydrates and fats to help keep
the weight off"

@ ©@ “After age 30, cell metabolism is reduced and body composition changes, so you will need twice as
much exercise.”

©) "It is hard to say what is contributing to your problems keeping the weight off and staying toned
because everyone ages differently."

That's right!

Rationale
After age 30, cell metabolism reduces and body composition changes, so individuals need 300 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity per week. Insulin sensitivity and production do decline during the aging process,

but this does not provide an explanation for the client’s concern. Dietary needs change according to living and
working situations; however, changes in types of carbohydrates and fats would not necessarily be

recommended or necessary, although a decrease in empty calories is recommended. Although there is a wider
variety of manifestations of aging, this does not directly address or answer the question that client is asking.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong

response. No real absolutes exist in life; every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p.199
Question 48

An adult client has begun a cardiovascular exercise program. Which macronutrient will the
client’s body utilize for aerobic metabolism? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Water

Cy) @| Protein

Ol Fat

@ [| Carbohydrates

Calcium

Magnesium

That's right!

Rationale

Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates all provide energy for aerobic metabolism. Water is necessary for staying

hydrated, but it is not a macronutrient. Calcium and magnesium are micronutrients.

p. 200
Question 49

Which consideration is an area of concern for a patient who is taking several commonly
prescribed medications including blood pressure medication and laxatives. Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Hip fractures

| Dehydration

Drug interactions

Decreased compliance

ncreased insurance costs

So close!

Rationale

Polypharmacy is correlated with falls and hip fractures; dehydration and drug interactions can occur; too
many medications can lead to decreased compliance; and increased insurance costs are a consequence of
polypharmacy.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 205
Question 50

A new nursing assistant is helping residents in the dining room. Which recommendation
would the supervising nurse make to help encourage the older residents to eat?
rv) © Identify each food being offered to the resident.

O Explain the health benefits of finishing the meal.
O Feed two residents at once so both will eat more.

O Offer liquids at the end of the meal to increase solid food intake.

That's right!

Rationale

Identifying all food offered provides the resident with independent choices. Moralizing by suggesting health
benefits of finishing a meal is not recommended; feeding two residents at once does not give the
individualized attention needed; liquids are offered throughout the meal to prevent dehydration.

p. 202
Question 51

The home health nurse notes a recent weight loss without any other changes in health
status for an older patient. The patient reports a lack of appetite since the loss of a partner.
Which recommendation would the nurse make?

© Exploring assisted living facilities

© Starting Meals on Wheels delivery
@ © Attending meals at a senior center

© ©@ Beginning antidepressant medication

So close!

Rationale

Congregate nutrition services such as meals at a senior center provides adults who are older than 60 years of
age with nutritionally sound meals to access to both wholesome food and social support, with some facilities
providing other services, including nutrition screening, education, assessment, and counseling. Participants
often eat healthier with improved overall health when attending this type of program. Assisted living facilities

and antidepressants are not recommended at first; Meals on Wheels does not provide the social support often
needed.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 208
Question 52

Which initial recommendation would be given to a patient who is overweight, with slightly

elevated blood sugar noted at the last check-up?
O Insulin therapy

rv) © Physical activity

O Oral antidiabetics

O Re-evaluation at the next appointment

That's right!

Rationale

A slightly elevated blood sugar indicates decreased glucose tolerance (prediabetes syndrome). Insulin response
to glucose in the bloodstream is inadequate to maintain euglycemia and needs further investigation. Because
the patient is overweight, the initial recommendation would be weight management in the form of increasing
physical activity. Insulin therapy is not appropriate for prediabetes treatment. Physical activity declines with
age, so weight management through regular physical activity for prediabetes, along with balanced meals and
snacks, rather than oral antidiabetics, is recommended to avoid hyperglycemia and potentially delay or avoid
the onset of type 2 diabetes. Because it is already known that the patient is overweight and there is a
confirmed elevation in glucose level, it would not be appropriate to wait for a subsequent appointment and

reassessment to provide basic guidance such as increasing physical activity.

p. 204
Question 53

When examining the oral cavity of an elderly patient, the nurse notes several missing teeth
and signs of xerostomia. Based on these findings, the nurse would assess for which

concern? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | Presence of periodontal disease

| Need for dentures

Need for caregiving services

Cy) | Impaired nutritional status
@ |B) Difficulty chewing food

So close!

Rationale

Poor oral health is indicative of reduced overall health and quality of life in the elderly, increasing the risk for
malnutrition. Missing teeth and xerostomia in the elderly increase the risk for malnutrition. Chewing can be
difficult with missing teeth, dental caries, or periodontal disease, and a lack of saliva makes tasting and the
breakdown of food difficult as well. Need for dentures or a caregiver are not indicated for this patient at this
point.

p. 202
Question 54

Which statement concerning aging and the metabolic rate are accurate? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| The change reflects lean muscle mass loss.

he metabolic rate decline begins after puberty.

he loss of skeletal muscle mass cannot be reversed.

he change reflects loss of high metabolically active organ tissues.

he rate of change in muscle mass and organ tissues levels off at age 65.

That's right!

Rationale

Reduced metabolic rate reflects both lean muscle mass loss and loss of high metabolically active organ
tissues. Metabolism begins to decline after 30, not after puberty. The loss of skeletal muscle can be reversed.

The rate of change of muscle mass and organ tissues does not level off at age 65.

p. 199
Question 55

Which physical change of aging affects gastrointestinal functions? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Less vitamin absorption

ncreased salivary secretions

| Inadequate hydrochloric acid secretion

Decreased gastrointestinal motility

m| Diminished secretion of digestive juices

That's right!

Rationale

Secretion of digestive juices lessens, and the motility of gastrointestinal muscles gradually weaken, which
together causes diminished absorption and bioavailability of nutrients such as vitamins. Inadequate
hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach occurs with aging. Physical effects of aging include a decrease, not

increase, in salivary secretions.

pp. 200, 202
Question 56

An older adult client admitted to the nursing home receives a screening score of 7 points

on the mini nutritional assessment (MNA). What is the nurse’s priority action?
rv) O Notify the health care provider.

O Do nothing; the score is acceptable.
x) © Review the client’s eating habits.

O Assist the client in choosing healthier foods.

So close!

Rationale

The nurse’s priority action is to notify the health care provider. The older adult client with a screening score of
7 points on the MNA is considered malnourished and requires nutritional intervention. This score is not
acceptable. Reviewing eating habits and assisting the client in choosing healthier foods can be done once the
client is stabilized with the help of the health care provider. There may be many reasons the client is
malnourished, and these can be addressed after the client’s nutrition is improved.

Test-Taking Tip: If the question asks for an immediate action or response, all of the answers may be correct, so

base your selection on identified priorities for action.

That's right!

Rationale
Factors that contribute to malnutrition in the older adult include economic insecurity, social isolation, and
decreased gastric motility. Dentures do not contribute to malnutrition in the older adult unless they are ill-

fitting. Hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach is decreased, not increased, with age.

Taking multiple medications is known as polypharmacy. Polypharmacy can adversely affect the overall
nutritional status by altering the client’s fluid balance, affecting appetite, and inhibiting absorption of
nutrients. Although different medications may have adverse interactions with certain supplements,
polypharmacy itself does not necessarily cause supplement toxicity. The drugs are meant to reduce disease
symptoms; this does not necessarily affect nutrition.

Question 68

The nurse is completing a mini nutritional assessment (MNA) on the client. How would the
nurse score a client who has a moderate decrease in food consumption but no weight loss
in the past 3 months; is able to fairly independently leave the home; suffers from mild

dementia; has suffered the loss of a spouse one month ago; and has a body mass index of

20.5? Record your answer using a whole number. @) 8

That's right!

Rationale

According to the MNA, a score of 1 would be assigned to the moderate decrease in food consumption, a score
of 3 for no weight loss in the past 3 months, a score of 2 for the ability to independently leave the home, a
score of 1 for the mild dementia, a score of 0 because of recent loss (within 3 months) of spouse, and a score
of 1 for a body mass index of 20.5, which totals 8. A score of 8 places the individual at risk for malnutrition.

Question 69

Which statement about metabolism and weight management in middle-aged adults is

accurate?

O Exercise needs to increase incrementally to help keep weight off.
rv) O There is a need for fewer kilocalories because of a declining metabolic rate.
x) © Different types of foods will be needed to address changing metabolism.

O Bodily energy needs will require increased intake of fats instead of carbohydrates.

So close!

Rationale

When physical maturity is reached, energy requirements decrease, the metabolic rate decreases, and the need
for fewer kilocalories becomes important for weight management. Exercise needs do not necessarily increase;
balancing exercise and nutritional intake will be important. Adults do not require different types of foods to

address changing metabolism, nor is there a need to increase the intake of fats versus carbohydrates to meet
the energy needs of the body.

p. 198
Question 70

Which substance should be avoided when taking antihypertensive medications?
O St. John’s wort

@ @ Grapefruit juice
© Antidepressants
© Alcohol products

That's right!

Rationale

When taking antihypertensives, it is recommended to avoid taking them with grapefruit juice, which can
prevent the medication from being absorbed. St. John’s wort, antidepressants, and alcohol products do not
cause interactions or inhibit the action of antihypertensive medication.

p. 206
Question 71

Which description is the pathophysiologic basis for reduced cell metabolism beginning at
approximately 30 years of age?

O Multiple hormonal changes
x) © Changes in body composition
rv) O A gradual loss of functioning cells

O Decreased bodily demand for energy

So close!

Rationale

At approximately age 30, a gradual loss of functioning cells begins, resulting in reduced cell metabolism.
Multiple hormonal changes cause a variety of issues at different ages that impact health but are not
implicated in relation to cell metabolism. Changes in body composition also occur because of the gradual loss
of functioning cells, so this is not a pathophysiologic basis for reduced cell metabolism. A decreased bodily
demand for energy is not related to reduced cell metabolism as one ages but rather the result of it.

p. 199
Question 72

Which vitamin D dosage meets the requirement of individuals who are older than 70 years?
© 400 lU/day

@ © 600 1u/Day
@ © 300 lU/day

© 1000 lU/day

So close!

Rationale

The dietary reference intake (DRI) for vitamin D is 800 |U/day for individuals who are older than 70 years of
age. The DRI for vitamin D is 600 IU/day for individuals 1 to 70 years of age. Vitamin D dosage of 400 IU/day

is not adequate for individuals who are older than 70 years of age, whereas a dosage of 1000 |U/day is more
than the daily requirement.

p. 201
Question 73

An older patient being seen in a community clinic is noted to have a body mass index (BMI)
of 30. After ascertaining dietary habits and income information, which program does the
nurse recommend?

O Meals on Wheels
tx} © Congregate nutrition services
O Human Nutrition Research Center

@ © Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

So close!

Rationale
A BMI of 30 indicates obesity. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides nutrition

education and obesity prevention interventions. Meals on Wheels and congregate nutrition services provide
low-cost meals but not interventions and education clearly needed by this patient. The Human Nutrition
Research Center is a research facility that does not provide direct patient services.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 207
Question 74

Once an individual reaches early adulthood, which best reflects the process of physical

growth?
O Physical growth is completed by adulthood and begins a slow decline.

O Physical growth is genetically predetermined and stops after adolescence.
rv) © The physical growth process involves the vital growth of new cells to replace old cells.

O Physical growth continues throughout life and requires an increasing number of cells.

That's right!

Rationale

Physical growth and maturity levels off during the early adult years, and physical growth becomes a process of
vital growth of new cells rather than increasing numbers of cells for growth and development. Physical growth
and maturity are governed by genetic potential and level off in the early adult years; it is not complete at
adulthood, nor does it stop at the end of adolescence. Physical growth in adulthood is about growth of new
cells to replace old cells, not increasing numbers of cells.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 198
Question 75

Which statement provides the most accurate information about metabolic changes related
to aging in men and women?

rv) O Basal metabolic rate declines for both sexes with a more rapid decline beginning earlier for men than
for women.

© There are no real sex differences when it comes to declines in basal metabolic rate; an average of 1%
to 2% per decade is normal.

© The basal metabolic rate generally declines more rapidly for women, which is why women tend to
gain weight more easily with age.

© @ The basal metabolic rate declines similarly for men and women with an estimated 5% decrease in
metabolic activity during the middle and older years.

So close!

Rationale

Basal metabolic rate declines 1% to 2% per decade, with a more rapid decline beginning at age 40 for men
and age 50 for women. Basal metabolic rate does decline 1% to 2% per decade, but an increased rate of
decline begins earlier for men than women, so this is an incorrect statement. The basal metabolic rate begins
a more rapid decline for men at age 40 and women at age 50, so stating that the rate declines more rapidly for
women is incorrect. The basal metabolic rate does decline an estimated 5% overall during the middle and
older years, but there is a more rapid decline that begins earlier for men than women, so this statement does

not best respond to the question.

p. 200
Question 76

What is the most effective way for the nurse to assist with the feeding of an older adult

client? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Alternate foods after each bite.

Provide liquids at the end of the meal.

| Identify the food that is being served.

| Remain focused on the client.

Encourage the client by stating "Eat this because it is good for you."

That's right!

Rationale

The most effective way for the nurse to assist with feeding an older adult is to identify the food that is being
served and remain focused on the client. Foods should not be switched after every bite. The client should have
at least three bites of the same food before going to another food to allow time for the taste buds to become
accustomed to the food. Liquids should be given throughout the meal and not just at the beginning or end of
the meal. The statement "Eat this because it is good for you" has little value for anyone, especially for those
who are struggling to maintain their personal integrity and self-esteem in a youth-oriented, age-fearing
culture.

p. 202
Question 77

Which statement about metabolism and weight management in middle-aged adults is
accurate?

O Exercise needs to increase incrementally to help keep weight off.
rv) © There is a need for fewer kilocalories because of a declining metabolic rate.
O Different types of foods will be needed to address changing metabolism.

O Bodily energy needs will require increased intake of fats instead of carbohydrates.

That's right!

Rationale

When physical maturity is reached, energy requirements decrease, the metabolic rate decreases, and the need
for fewer kilocalories becomes important for weight management. Exercise needs do not necessarily increase;
balancing exercise and nutritional intake will be important. Adults do not require different types of foods to
address changing metabolism, nor is there a need to increase the intake of fats versus carbohydrates to meet

the energy needs of the body.

p. 198
Question 78

What is the leading cause of unintentional weight loss in the older adult client?

© Impaired physical function

O Failure to thrive

Cy) © Depression

O Limited access to health care

That's right!

Rationale

Depression is the leading cause of unintentional weight loss in older adults. Impaired physical function can be
a contributing factor for unintentional weight loss in some instances, but it is not the leading cause.
Unintentional weight loss is a symptom in an older adult diagnosed with failure to thrive. Failure to thrive is
generally multifactorial and caused by a combination of chronic diseases associated with impaired physical
function, malnutrition, depression, and cognitive impairment. Limited access to health care contributes to a
higher risk for poor health and death, but it is not the leading cause of weight loss in older adults.

p. 198
Question 79

Which age is forecasted to be the median in the United States by the year 2060?

That's right!

Rationale
The median age will increase from 38 to 43 by 2060, with women outnumbering men in the eldest groups.

Eighteen, 38, and 65 are not the forecasted average median age of the U.S. population by the year 2060.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect, and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question
that requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a

problem, read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 195
Question 80

Which food/nutrient can cause an adverse reaction in an older adult client taking a

nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)?

rv) O Alcohol
x) © Grapefruit juice
O Licorice

O Caffeine

So close!

Rationale

Alcohol should be avoided for the older adult client taking an NSAID. Grapefruit juice should be avoided for a
client taking antihyperlipidemics and antihistamines. Licorice should be avoided for a client taking
antihypertensives. Caffeine should be avoided for clients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

p. 206
Question 81

How can a decrease in hypothalamic function adversely affect an older adult client?

© Increases skeletal muscle loss
@ ©@ Increases the risk for dehydration
© Promotes unintentional weight gain

© Increases the risk for osteoporosis

That's right!

Rationale

The decrease in hypothalamic function reduces thirst in older adults, which results in an increased risk for
dehydration. An increased loss of skeletal muscle mass occurs as a result of inadequate dietary protein
metabolism and physical activity. Unintentional weight gain results from nutritional problems. The increased
risk for osteoporosis occurs significantly with age and is a result of poor bone health. Some contributing

factors include inadequate vitamin D and calcium intake.

p. 202
Question 82

Which description is the pathophysiologic basis for reduced cell metabolism beginning at
approximately 30 years of age?
O Multiple hormonal changes

O Changes in body composition
rv) © A gradual loss of functioning cells

O Decreased bodily demand for energy

That's right!

Rationale

At approximately age 30, a gradual loss of functioning cells begins, resulting in reduced cell metabolism.
Multiple hormonal changes cause a variety of issues at different ages that impact health but are not
implicated in relation to cell metabolism. Changes in body composition also occur because of the gradual loss
of functioning cells, so this is not a pathophysiologic basis for reduced cell metabolism. A decreased bodily
demand for energy is not related to reduced cell metabolism as one ages but rather the result of it.

Question 1
—

Which bacteria was the cause of a recent deadly outbreak of dysentery in Japan?
© Escherichia coli ( E. coli)

O Salmonella

© @ Campylobacter
@ O Shigella

So close!

Rationale

Shigella caused a deadly outbreak of dysentery in Japan. E. coli may result in serious infections or renal failure
and death. Salmonella produces mild-to-bloody diarrhea. Campylobacter infections have been associated with
Guillain-Barré syndrome and other neuropathies.

Question 2
—

Which definition matches the "Light or Lite" descriptive term on food products?
@ © Atleast one-third reduction in kilocalories

© ©@ Less than 0.5 g of fat per serving
© At least a 25% reduction in sodium

© 20% or more of daily value (DV) per serving

So close!

Rationale

The Food and Drug Administration has specifically defined many terms whose definitions must be met if used
on a food product. " Light or Lite" indicates a reduction in kilocalories of at least one third. If the product has
less than 0.5 g of fat per serving, the term will be "Fat free," not "Light or Lite." If the product has at least a
25% reduction in sodium, it will be termed "Reduced/less sodium." If the product has 20% or more of the DV
per serving, it will be termed "High."

Test-Taking Tip: Look for answers that focus on the patient or are directed toward feelings.

p.214
Question 3

Which statement describes Clostridium botulinum food poisoning? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Canned foods are at high risk for contamination with botulinum.
Botulinum spores are found in soil and may be present in harvested food.
Symptoms of botulinum poisoning appear within 18 to 36 hours.

It causes sudden-onset paralysis.

Nausea, vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, and slurred speech are typical initial symptoms.

So close!

Rationale

Canned foods are a high-risk food for botulism contamination. Like all clostridia, this species is anaerobic or

nearly so. The relatively air-free can and canning temperatures (227°C [80°F]) provide good conditions for

toxin production. C. botulinum spores are widespread in soil throughout the world and may accompany

harvested food to the food-processing plant. Depending on the dose of toxin consumed and the individual

response, symptoms will appear within 18 to 36 hours. Nausea, vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, and

slurred speech are typical initial symptoms. The toxin progressively irritates motor nerve cells and blocks the

transmission of neural impulses at the nerve terminals, thereby causing a gradual paralysis.

p. 227
Question 4
—

Which feature is associated with the bacterial food infection caused by Escherichia coli?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Loose, watery stools

m| Cramping and abdominal pain

Begins 14 days after infection

iv)
rv) m| Low-grade fever
iv)

m| Can develop hemolytic uremic syndrome

That's right!

Rationale

Most cases of infection with E. coli involve diarrhea, stomach cramps, and low-grade fevers that start within 2
to 8 days after ingestion and that usually resolve within 7 days. Approximately 5% to 10% of individuals

infected with E. coli will develop hemolytic uremic syndrome.

p.224
Question 5
—

Which statement is true regarding the tracking of foodborne illnesses?

© The reporting of outbreaks of foodborne illness to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
more likely to occur than is the reporting of individual instances of illness.

© ©@ The FDA tracks, investigates, and reports the incidence of foodborne illness in the United States.
© Local, state, and tribal health departments voluntarily report foodborne illness to the FDA.

@ © The estimated cases of foodborne illness are extrapolations of actual reported cases.

So close!

Rationale

The estimated cases of foodborne illness are extrapolations of actual reported cases, as the reporting
outbreaks of foodborne illness to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is more likely than the
reporting of individual instances of illness. Outbreaks of foodborne illness are reported to the CDC, not the
FDA. The CDC tracks, investigates, and reports the incidence of foodborne illness in the United States, but its
ability to do so is dependent on the victim reporting the illness. Local, state, and tribal health departments
voluntarily report foodborne illness to the CDC.

p. 220
Question 6
—

Which purpose is served by food additives? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

x) | Killing bacteria and parasites that are on the food after harvest

| Producing a uniform color in food

Improving crop yields

rv) | Preserving foods by preventing oxidation

m| Enriching foods with added nutrients

So close!

Rationale

Food additives can be used to produce uniform food qualities such as color or aroma. It is also used to
preserve food by preventing oxidation. Food additives enrich foods with added nutrients. The process of
irradiation, not the use of food additives, kills bacteria and parasites that are present on the food after harvest.

Agricultural pesticides, not food additives, are used to improve crop yields.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 218
Question 7
a

Which description is a feature of food irradiation? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

rv) | Kills bacteria and parasites that are on food after harvest

rv) | Increases the shelf life of produce

rv) mw] Ensures unaltered nutritive value of food

Uses biologic processes or organisms to make or modify products

Makes food radioactive

That's right!

Rationale

Irradiation of food kills bacteria and parasites that are on food after harvest. Irradiation also increases the shelf
life of produce. The process of irradiation ensures unaltered nutritive value of food. Irradiation does not use
biologic processes or organisms to make or modify products. Irradiated foods are not radioactive.

Question &
a

Which standard does the labeling category "Organic" define?
©) Produced exclusively with certified organic ingredients

@ © Contains at least 95% organic ingredients
© ©@ Made with at least 70% certified organic ingredients

© Made with less than 70% certified organic ingredients

So close!

Rationale
According to the standards/guidelines for organic foods under the National Organic Program, products

labeled as "Organic "must contain at least 95% organic ingredients and must have passed a government
inspection. Products that carry "100% organic" label must be made or produced exclusively with certified
organic ingredients, and they must have passed a government inspection. Products with "Made with Organic"
label must be made with at least 70% certified organic ingredients and list up to three ingredients or food
groups. Foods made with less than 70% certified organic ingredients may not use the USDA Organic Seal or
make any organic claims on the front panel of the package. They can list the specific organic ingredients on
the side panel of the package.

Question 9
a

Daily values (DVs) are reference values that relate the nutritional information to a total daily
diet of 2000 kcal. Which statement corresponds to the correct understanding of the
percentage DV (%DV)?

O %DV is the daily nutritional requirement of the nutrient for a teenage girl.
O %DV is the daily nutritional requirement of the nutrient for a sedentary male.
O %DV is the reference value that relates the nutritional information to a total diet of 2500 kcal.

@ @ %DV is how much a nutrient in a single serving of an individual packaged food or dietary supplement
contributes to your daily diet.

That's right!

Rationale

%DV is how much a nutrient in a single serving of an individual packaged food or dietary supplement
contributes to your daily diet. DVs are reference values that relate the nutrition information to a total daily diet
of 2000 kcal, which is appropriate for most women, teenage girls, and some sedentary men. The footnote

indicates the daily values for a 2500-kcal diet, which meets the needs of most men, teenage boys, and active

women.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices

will seem like the correct response.

p.214
Question 10

Which criterion applies to health claims that link nutrients to risk for disease?

© Health claims must appear on the front of the package.
© @ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve only the wording on the package.
© The health claim does not have to be approved by the FDA.

@ © A physician statement must accompany the claim and define the risk.

So close!

Rationale
The FDA strictly regulates health claims that link nutrients or food groups with a risk for disease. A physician

statement must accompany the claim and define the risk for the disease. Health claims may appear on the
front, side, or back of the food package. To make an association between a food product and a specific disease,
the FDA must approve both the claim and the wording used on the package.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very
cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and in an area as complex
as nursing, an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a

guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number
of choices.

p.215
Question 11
a

Which governing body is responsible for regulating the movement of food between state

lines?
O Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

rv) O U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
O Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

x) © Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)

So close!

Rationale

The EDA is charged with ensuring that the United States’ food supply is safe by enforcing food sanitation and
quality control, governing food additives, regulating the movement of foods across state lines, supervising the
nutrition labeling of foods, and ensuring the safety of public food service. The FTC regulates the advertising
and truthful marketing of food products. The CDC monitors and investigates cases of foodborne illnesses. The
Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA is responsible for food safety of both domestic and imported
meat, poultry, and processed egg products.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: [f you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about

that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie

diet).

When setting up a food assistance program for a community, which question is necessary

for the nurse to consider when developing program goals to address relevance?

x) © Is the task realistic?

rv) O Is the goal or activity important or worth doing?
O Are standards available to assist in setting goals?

O Are sufficient resources available to complete the project?

So close!

Rationale

Asking if the goal or activity is important or worth doing addresses relevance. Asking if the task is realistic
addresses achievability, not relevance. Asking if standards are available to assist in setting goals addresses
measurability, not relevance. Asking if sufficient resources are available to complete the project addresses

achievability, not relevance.

A pregnant woman is advised to avoid food containing high levels of mercury. Which food

should the woman avoid completely?

© Salmon

O Catfish
@ © Swordfish

© Shrimp

That's right!

Rationale

Pregnant women should avoid seafood high in mercury, including swordfish, canned albacore tuna, shark,
king mackerel, and tilefish. Women who are pregnant or nursing or who might become pregnant should eat
no more than 12 oz per week of low-mercury fish, such as salmon, catfish, shrimp, and pollock.

p. 231
Question 14

How soon after consuming contaminated food do symptoms of foodborne illness appear?
© 2 to 4 hours

tx} © 1 to 3 hours

O 2 to 5 hours

Cy) O 1 to 6 hours

So close!

Rationale

Symptoms of foodborne illness can appear 1 to 6 hours after eating contaminated food. The time spans of 2

to 4 hours, 1 to 3 hours, and 2 to 5 hours do not cover the full possible span of 1 to 6 hours.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly
answering each question.

Question 15

Which is a chemical additive used in meats to prevent rancidity and botulism?
© Emulsifier

O Sequestrant

O Humectants

Cy) © Sodium nitrite

That's right!

Rationale

Sodium nitrite is a chemical additive used in meats to prevent spoilage and botulism. Emulsifiers are used to
keep water and fat-soluble ingredients evenly distributed in a food. Sequestrants are used to prevent changes
in flavor, color, or appearance of foods by binding with metals. Humectants help retain moisture in foods to

prevent them from becoming hard or stiff.

Question 16

Which bacteria may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome?

@ ©@ Escherichia coli ( E.coli)
O Listeria

O Salmonella

© Shigella

That's right!

Rationale

E. coli may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome. Listeria may cause a variety of symptoms, such as diarrhea, flu-
like fever and headache, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, and endocarditis. Salmonella may cause severe
dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea. Shigella may cause dangerous diarrhea, cramps, fever, vomiting, and
blood or mucus in the stool.

Which program will require certification of medical or nutrition risk by a health care

professional in addition to qualifying income level?

O School Nutrition Program
rv) O Women, Infants, and Children Program
x) © Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

O Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program

So close!

Rationale

The Women, Infants, and Children Program requires certification of medical or nutrition risk by a health care
professional in addition to income level as requirements for participation in the program. The School
Nutrition Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Expanded Food and Nutrition Education

Program do not require certification of medical or nutrition risk.

Question 18
Es

Which area of concern is associated with the use of agricultural pesticides? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Production of crops with a disorderly general appearance

Presence of pesticide residues on foods

The gradual leaching of these chemicals into groundwater

The increased exposure of farm workers to these chemicals

The increased amount of chemicals necessary as insects develop tolerance

That's right!

Rationale

The four general areas of concern regarding the use of agricultural pesticides are (1) pesticide residues on
foods, (2) the gradual leaching of the chemicals into groundwater and surrounding wells, (3) the increased
exposure of farm workers to these chemicals, (4) the increased amount of chemicals necessary as insects
develop tolerance. The possibility of producing crops with a disorderly general appearance is not a concern
associated with the use of agricultural pesticides.

more likely to occur than is the reporting of individual instances of illness.

© The FDA tracks, investigates, and reports the incidence of foodborne illness in the United States.
© Local, state, and tribal health departments voluntarily report foodborne illness to the FDA.

@ @ The estimated cases of foodborne illness are extrapolations of actual reported cases.

That's right!

Rationale
The estimated cases of foodborne illness are extrapolations of actual reported cases, as the reporting

outbreaks of foodborne illness to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is more likely than the

reporting of individual instances of illness. Outbreaks of foodborne illness are reported to the CDC, not the

FDA. The CDC tracks, investigates, and reports the incidence of foodborne illness in the United States, but its
ability to do so is dependent on the victim reporting the illness. Local, state, and tribal health departments
voluntarily report foodborne illness to the CDC.

Question 23
SS

Which purpose is served by food additives? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Killing bacteria and parasites that are on the food after harvest

rv) | Producing a uniform color in food

rv) | Preserving foods by preventing oxidation

Improving crop yields

rv) m| Enriching foods with added nutrients

That's right!

Rationale

Food additives can be used to produce uniform food qualities such as color or aroma. It is also used to
preserve food by preventing oxidation. Food additives enrich foods with added nutrients. The process of
irradiation, not the use of food additives, kills bacteria and parasites that are present on the food after harvest.

Agricultural pesticides, not food additives, are used to improve crop yields.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 24

Which standard does the labeling category "Organic" define?
©) Produced exclusively with certified organic ingredients

@ ©@ Contains at least 95% organic ingredients
© Made with at least 70% certified organic ingredients

© Made with less than 70% certified organic ingredients

That's right!

Rationale

According to the standards/guidelines for organic foods under the National Organic Program, products
labeled as "Organic "must contain at least 95% organic ingredients and must have passed a government
inspection. Products that carry "100% organic" label must be made or produced exclusively with certified
organic ingredients, and they must have passed a government inspection. Products with "Made with Organic"
label must be made with at least 70% certified organic ingredients and list up to three ingredients or food
groups. Foods made with less than 70% certified organic ingredients may not use the USDA Organic Seal or
make any organic claims on the front panel of the package. They can list the specific organic ingredients on
the side panel of the package.

Question 25

Which change has been made in the updated Nutrition Facts Label? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

No longer includes serving sizes

Uses a small font size for calories per serving

No longer includes calories from fat below the total calories

Includes added sugars and the respective percent daily value (%DV)

Includes vitamin D and potassium as required nutrients on the label

So close!

Rationale

The Nutrition Facts Label no longer includes calories from fat below the total calories. The label has does
include added sugars, and the respective %DV in order to distinguish between naturally occurring sugars
from added sugars. Vitamin D and potassium will replace vitamin A and vitamin C as required nutrients on
the label because the latter two are no longer of public health concern as nutrient deficiencies, whereas
vitamin D and potassium intake are generally inadequate. The Nutrition Facts Label continues to include

serving sizes. A larger, not smaller, font size is being used for calories per serving, not a smaller font size.

Question 26

Which feature describes front-of- package labeling used by food manufacturers? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Needs to be text heavy and less symbolic

| Broadcasts nutrition information

Mandatory for the manufacturer to comply

Cy) Includes graded summary labels such as Nutri-Score labels and the 5-Color Nutrition Label

| Needs to be visually easy to interpret

So close!

Rationale

Many food manufacturers use front-of-package labeling to broadcast nutrition information. Front-of-package
labeling includes graded summary labels such as the multiple traffic light labels, Nutri-Score labels, and the
5-Color Nutrition Label, which are the most well accepted and comprehensive way to help individuals identify
healthier food options. Front-of-package labeling needs to be visually easy to interpret. Front of package
labeling should be symbolic, less text heavy, and understandable despite education level or native language. It

is currently voluntary for manufacturers to comply with front-of-package labeling use.

Question 27

Which step is performed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enforce food

safety regulations? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Regulating the advertising and truthful marketing of food products

Governing food additives

a
| Regulating the movement of foods across state lines
a

Supervising the nutrition labeling of foods

Ensuring the safety of public food service

So close!

Rationale

The FDA governs food additives. The agency is also responsible for regulating the movement of foods across
state lines. The FDA supervises the nutrition labeling of foods and ensures the safety of public food services.
The regulation of advertisement and truthful marketing of food products is the responsibility of the Federal
Trade Commission, not the FDA.

p. 211
Question 28
SS

Which current requirement regarding the food label is included in the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) standards of how food labels appear on food products? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Must include calories from fat

A larger font for fat calories per serving

| Vitamin A and vitamin C content required

Must include percentage of added sugars

| Typical consumption reflects a serving size

So close!

Rationale

The current FDA-approved Nutrition Facts Label includes the following requirements: added sugars and the
respective percent of daily value included with serving sizes that reflect typical consumption; vitamin D and
potassium is required; and the Daily Reference Values now reflect the current Dietary Reference Intakes values.
Calories from fat are no longer required to be on the label. A larger font size is required to draw attention to
calories per serving, not for calories from fat. Vitamin A and vitamin C are no longer a public health concern

for nutrient deficiencies and are not required to be on the food label.

p. 213
Question 29
SS

Which is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirement of labeling of food

products? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Fill of container

Fortification of food

| Food contains an allergen

| All ingredients are listed for foods with no established reference standard

Single-ingredient foods to be marked as an allergen

So close!

Rationale

Food standard information on labels relates to food quality, fill of container, and enrichment or fortification.
Food labels must also note major food allergens. The basic standards of identity require that labels on foods
that do not have an established reference standard must list all of the ingredients in order of relative amount
found in the product. Single-ingredient foods that are also allergens do not need to be marked as containing
the allergen. For example, eggs do not require to be marked as "contains eggs."

Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all
options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely. Example: [fthe answer you are seeking is directed to a
specific treatment and all but one option deals with signs and symptoms, you would be correct in choosing the
treatment-specific option.

Question 30

At which temperature should cold foods be kept below to prevent microbial growth?
@ © 40°F

© 48°F

© 52°F

OQ 60°F

That's right!

Rationale
Cold foods should be kept below 40°F to prevent microbial growth. Any temperature above 40°F, including
48°F, 52°F, and 60°F, can allow for the growth of microorganisms.

Question 31

Which federal department oversees food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program, the School Nutrition Program, and the Nutrition Program
for the Elderly?

© Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
@ ©@ United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
©) Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)

© Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

That's right!

Rationale

The USDA oversees most food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,
the School Nutrition Program, and the Nutrition Program for the Elderly. The FDA, DHHS, and CDC are

involved in other aspects of nutrition and health promotion.

p. 232
Question 32

Which U.S. organization assists in overseeing the sales and use of genetically modified
crops?
O Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

O Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
rv) © Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

O Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

That's right!

Rationale

The FDA assists in overseeing the sales and use of genetically modified crops. Other agencies involved in
oversight include the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Agriculture. The
CDC is part of DHHS and works to protect U.S. citizens from health, safety, and security threats. The mission
of the DHHS is to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all U.S. citizens by providing effective
health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. The mission
of the DHS includes preventing terrorism, enhancing national security, managing U.S. borders, administering
immigration laws, securing cyberspace, and ensuring safety and protection during disasters.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 217
Question 33

What is the most important role of nutrition labeling for consumers?

© To provide information about alternative food products
@ @ 10 provide information needed to make healthy food choices
© To list calories per serving of the packaged food product

© To list additives that may result in an allergic reaction

That's right!

Rationale

The purpose of nutrition labeling for consumers is to provide information needed to make healthy choices
about foods. Nutrition labels do not give information about alternative food products. Nutrition labels list
calories per serving; however, there is more information than calories to assist the consumer in health food
selection. Additives in the food may be listed on the nutrition label; however, preventing allergic reactions is

only one possible purpose of food labeling.

pp. 211-212
Question 34

What advice is most important in preventing foodborne illness?
@ © Handwashing before meals

© Handwashing after meals
© @ Washing the surfaces of countertops

© Heat all luncheon meats to steaming

So close!

Rationale

Handwashing with soap and water before meals is important advice to prevent foodborne illness. Clean hands
help prevent the spread of bacteria from the hands to the food in the meal. Handwashing after eating will not
prevent foodborne illness. Washing the surfaces of countertops is important, but hand hygiene is a greater
priority in preventing foodborne illness. Heating all lunch meats to steaming is advice given to pregnant

women to prevent infection with Listeria organisms.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,
pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 221
Question 35

Which program provides hot meals to people older than 60 years?
Cy) O Congregate Meals Program

© Special Supplemental Food Program
© Commodity Supplemental Food Program

© ©@ Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

So close!

Rationale

Regardless of income, all persons over the age of 60 years can eat hot lunches at a community center under
the Congregate Meals Program. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps people purchase food.
Under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) purchases
food items that are adequate in nutrients but that are often lacking in the diets of the targeted population. The
Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provides nutrition
supplementation, education and counseling, and referrals for health care and social services.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 233
Question 36

Which culprit is the greatest cause of foodborne illness?

O Viruses
Cy) © Bacteria

O Parasites
© Chemical agents

That's right!

Rationale
Foodborne illness can be caused by a variety of reasons, with approximately 52% of reported cases being

caused by bacteria. Forty-six percent of identified cases are caused by viruses. One percent of foodborne
illnesses are caused by parasites, and 1% are caused by chemical or toxic agents.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices
will seem like the correct response.

p. 220
Question 37

Which area of concern pertains to front-of-package labeling?

© Symbolic instead of text heavy

© Confusion with graded summary labeling
@ © Few federal regulations for standardization
© ©@ Nutri-Score labeling not easily understood

So close!

Rationale

Many food manufacturers use front-of-package labeling to broadcast nutrition information. Currently, there
are few federal regulations in place to standardize front-of-package labels. Ideally, front-of-package labeling
would be symbolic instead of text heavy and visually easy to interpret. Studies indicate that graded summary
labels, such as multiple traffic-light labels, Nutri-Score labels, or the 5-Color Nutrition Label, are the most well

accepted and comprehensive way to help individuals identify healthier food options.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

p.214
Question 38

Which of the following statements regarding preparing, serving, and storing food needs

correction?

x) © "An open package of hot dogs can safely remain in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
O "An unopened package of bologna can safely remain in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks."
O "Chicken should be cooked to reach an internal temperature of 170°F or higher."

rv) O "Cool hot foods to room temperature before refrigerating.”

So close!

Rationale

The statement that needs correction is: "Cool hot foods to room temperature before refrigerating." Food does
not need to be cooled to room temperature before refrigerating; in fact, this may result in bacterial growth.
Leftovers should be refrigerated within 2 hours. An open package of hot dogs can safely remain in the
refrigerator at a temperature 40°F or lower for up to 1 week. An unopened package of bologna can safely
remain in the refrigerator at a temperature 40°F or lower for up to 2 weeks. Chicken should be cooked to an

internal temperature of 170°F or higher.

p. 233
Question 39

Which of the following statements regarding food safety for an immunocompromised
patient is incorrect?

O “Avoid purchasing dented cans of food."
O "Pick up perishable foods, such as eggs or meat, last."
O "Do not purchase foods in cracked or chipped glass jars."

rv) © "Be sure the safety buttons on metal lids are up and activated."

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse requires correction when stating, "Be sure the safety buttons on metal lids are up and activated." If a
jar’s metal lid safety button is up and activated, the jar has previously been opened and is no longer sterile.
The nurse is correct in advising the patient to avoid dented cans, pick up perishable foods last, and avoid

cracked or chipped glass jars.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details. Details provided in the stem of the item, such as behavioral changes or
clinical changes (or both) within a certain time period, can provide a clue to the most appropriate response or, in

some Casé€s, responses.

p. 228
Question 40

The Partnership for Food Safety Education developed the "Fight BAC!" campaign to prevent
foodborne illness. According to this campaign, which is a critical action for increasing food

safety? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | Washing hands and surfaces often

@ |B] Separating foods to avoid cross-contamination

@ |B] Cooking foods to proper temperatures

Freezing condiments, especially mayonnaise

Cooking all meat to an internal temperature of 145°F

@ |B] Refrigerating foods promptly

That's right!

Rationale

The Partnership for Food Safety Education campaign "Fight BAC!" identifies four critical actions: washing
hands and surfaces often, separating foods to avoid cross-contamination, cooking foods to proper
temperatures, and refrigerating foods promptly. Freezing condiments is unnecessary, and mayonnaise should
not be frozen. Cooking all meats to an internal temperature of 145°F is incorrect; beef, poultry, and other

types of meat should be cooked to higher internal temperatures.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 221
Question 41

For produce, which method can be used to eliminate or reduce disease-causing germs after

harvest and increase shelf life without altering nutrition?

rv) © Irradiation

O Handwashing
O Cold storage

O Vacuum packaging

That's right!

Rationale

Irradiation can be used to eliminate or reduce disease-causing germs after harvest and increase the shelf life
of produce without altering taste. Handwashing is an important step in preventing foodborne illness before
preparing and consuming foods. Cold storage helps protect food from deterioration or decay but does not
eliminate disease-causing germs. Vacuum-packaged foods are only minimally processed and are not

sterilized; therefore they are at risk of temperature abuse.

p. 218
Question 42

Which of the following statements is the best response by a nurse to a patient who asks
about foods that are not exposed to pesticides and herbicides?

O “All foods are exposed to pesticides and herbicides. Why don’t you try to grow your own vegetables in
a garden?"

@ ©@ ‘Organic farming bans the use of pesticides and herbicides. Organic foods are available in most major
supermarkets.”

© "Perhaps you should explore the option of becoming a vegetarian. That way, you will not be exposed
to pesticides and herbicides."

"Try ordering all of your food online. You can find some great deals, and | bet you can find some
foods that are not exposed to pesticides and herbicides."

That's right!

Rationale

The best response by the nurse is " Organic farming bans the use of pesticides and herbicides. Organic foods
are available in most major supermarkets." It is inaccurate to say that all foods are exposed to pesticides and
herbicides; organic farming bans the use of such chemicals, and growing a garden may not be a realistic
option for the patient. Becoming a vegetarian does not eliminate exposure to pesticides and herbicides unless
all foods in that vegetarian diet are organic. Ordering food online may be an option; however, purchasing
organic foods in a supermarket may be more feasible.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,
pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

Question 43

Which of the following helps prevent exposure to Listeria organisms during pregnancy?

@ © Heat to steaming all luncheon and processed meats.
© Cook ground beef to a minimum temperature of 165°F.
©, Do not drink unpasteurized cider for the duration of pregnancy.

© ©@ Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consumption.

So close!

Rationale

Deli meats have been implicated in Listeria infections. If a pregnant woman chooses to eat luncheon or
processed meats, they should be heated to steaming before consumption. Cooking ground beef to a
minimum temperature of 165°F and not drinking unpasteurized cider for the duration of the pregnancy help
prevent infection with Escherichia coli, not Listeria, organisms. Washing all fruits and vegetables thoroughly

before consumption helps prevent infection with Shigella, not Listeria, organisms.

Rationale

Many food manufacturers use front-of-package labeling to broadcast nutrition information. Front-of-package

labeling includes graded summary labels such as the multiple traffic light labels, Nutri-Score labels, and the

5-Color Nutrition Label, which are the most well accepted and comprehensive way to help individuals identify

healthier food options. Front-of-package labeling needs to be visually easy to interpret. Front of package

Question 52

The development of bloody stools and fever after drinking unpasteurized apple cider is

most likely caused by which bacterial infection?
©) Salmonella

x) © Campylobacter

rv) O Escherichia coli
O Listeria

So close!

Rationale

The nurse suspects the patient is infected with E. coli. E. coli infection can cause bloody diarrhea and fever and
sometimes progresses to renal failure and death. Most outbreaks arise from consumption of unpasteurized or
undercooked food or contaminated water. Salmonella infection is associated with the consumption of eggs,
milk, custard, sandwich fillings, shellfish, and contaminated water, producing bloody diarrhea with fever.
Campylobacter infection causes acute diarrhea and is linked to the consumption of undercooked meats and
seafood, raw milk, and untreated water. Listeria usually infects people with suppressed immunity and has been
traced to unpasteurized milk, undercooked poultry, and processed meats.

will soak raw produce in water prior to peeling it."

Hl will wash each lettuce leaf under running water."

will gently scrub melons so that | do not remove the outer surface."

| "I will scrub fresh vegetables and fruits with a small vegetable brush."

So close!

Rationale

Safe food preparation includes removing and discarding the outmost leaves of a head of lettuce, washing each
lettuce leaf under running water, and scrubbing fresh fruits and vegetables with a small vegetable brush.
Fruits and vegetables should be stored in the refrigerator within 2 hours of peeling or cutting. Produce should
not be soaked, because this increases the risk of contamination. Melons should be scrubbed thoroughly to
remove any contaminants.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 54

Which matter is a general concern about the use of pesticides as it relates to food? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

The decrease in food yields

he increased tolerance of insects

he chemicals spread into the water

he consumer ingests the pesticide residue

i _e
4H A445

he increased exposure of farm workers to pesticides

That's right!

Rationale

Large American agricultural corporations as well as individual farmers use a number of chemicals to increase
their crop yield. The four general areas of concern surrounding the use of pesticides include the increased
amount of chemicals necessary as insects develop tolerance, the gradual leaching of chemicals into
groundwater and surrounding wells, the pesticide residues on food, and the increased exposure of farm

workers to these chemicals. Decreased food yields is why pesticides are used.

Which community resource utilizes the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to purchase
food items that are good sources of nutrients but lacking in the diets of a target
population?

© School Meals Program

O Nutrition Services Incentive Program
@ @ Commodity Supplemental Food Program

© Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

That's right!

Rationale
Under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, the USDA purchases food items that are nutritious but

that are often lacking in the diets of the target population. The USDA then distributes the food to state
agencies and tribal organizations. The School Meals Program provides breakfast and lunch to meet the
Dietary Guideline recommendations for many children who would otherwise lack balanced meals. The
Nutrition Services Incentive Program promotes socialization, health, and well-being for older individuals by

reducing hunger and food insecurity. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps people purchase

food.

Question 56

For which reason is tracking foodborne illness difficult? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

lm] Symptoms are nonspecific.

lm] Symptoms can be self-limiting.

Identification of the pathogen is difficult.

| Reporting of illness is dependent on the victim.

Health departments voluntarily report foodborne illness to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).

So close!

Rationale

Tracking the prevalence, food origin, and pathogen responsible for foodborne illness is a very difficult task.
The symptoms of foodborne illness are often difficult to distinguish from other forms of illness. Most forms
of foodborne illness are short-lived and self-limiting. Even if the person sees a physician, identifying the
pathogen responsible is difficult. The CDC tracks, investigates, and reports the incidence of foodborne illness,

but its ability to do so is dependent on the victim. Local, state, and tribal health departments voluntarily report
foodborne illness to the CDC.

Question 57

Which benefit do food additives provide? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

rv] | Prevent oxidation
rv] m| Improve flavor and texture
rv] | Produce uniform aroma
rv] mw Enrich the food with added nutrients
rv] | Prevent ingredients from separating
I °

That's right!

Rationale

The use of food additives helps prevent spoilage and extend shelf life. The expanding population, a larger
workforce, and more complex family life have increased the desire for more variety and convenience in foods.
Food additives help to preserve foods by preventing oxidation; controlling acidity and alkalinity to improve
flavor and texture; producing uniform qualities, such as color, flavor, texture, aroma, and general appearance;
and enriching foods with added nutrients. Additives also standardize functional factors that prevent

ingredients from separating before consumption.

p. 218
Question 58

Which statement supports a food product being labeled as "made with organic

ingredients?" Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| The food product must pass a government inspection.

The food must be made with at least 70% certified organic ingredients.

Ingredients must meet National Organic Program guidelines.

| The food product may display the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Organic Seal of approval.

| The food product may be advertised using the USDA Organic Seal.

So close!

Rationale

Organic foods have four labeling categories with specific guidelines for each. Products made with at least 70%
certified organic ingredients may state on the product label "made with organic ingredients" and list up to
three ingredients or food groups. These foods must also meet the National Organic Program guidelines for
growth and production without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, sewage sludge, bioengineering, or ionizing
radiation. A product must pass a government inspection if the food product is labeled as "100% organic." A
food product labeled as "made with organic ingredients" may not display the USDA Organic Seal or use it in
any advertising.

p. 216
Question 59

The nurse is teaching a pregnant patient about food safety risks. Which food should the
nurse teach the pregnant patient to avoid? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Sushi

@ [BM] Unpasteurized fruit juice
Cy) | Deli salads

Pasteurized skim milk

Whole-grain toast

Cy) Refrigerated meat spreads

So close!

Rationale

During pregnancy, the pregnant woman and her fetus have a higher risk of becoming sick from food
poisoning. Pregnant women should avoid rare, raw, or undercooked meats, poultry, and fish, such as sushi.
Pregnant women should also avoid unpasteurized fruit juice, milk, and vegetable juice. Deli salads (especially
those made with mayonnaise) should also be avoided. Refrigerated meat spreads and paté should not be

eaten during pregnancy. Pasteurized skim milk and whole-grain toast do not pose a food safety risk during

pregnancy.

Test-Taking Tip: Reread the question if the answers do not seem to make sense because you may have missed
words such as not or except in the statement.

p. 223
Question 60

Which response is the most accurate description of the impact of food processing on food

nutrient content?

rv) © "Vitamins and minerals are more affected by food processing than are carbohydrates, fats, and
proteins."

© "Vitamins A and D are completely stable during food-processing effects and are not lost during
processing.”

© "The minerals lost during the refining of cereal grains are added back after processing the refined
flours and cereals."

© "Processed foods based on synthetic materials can contribute significantly to daily dietary
requirements of vitamins and minerals."

That's right!

Rationale

The most accurate statement concerning food processing is that vitamins and minerals are more affected by
food processing than are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. No vitamin is completely stable during food
processing. Of the minerals lost during refining, only iron is added back. Processed foods based on synthetic

materials do not contribute significantly to daily dietary requirements of vitamins and minerals.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; however, every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p.215
Question 61

Which statement best reflects a recent change to the FDA's Nutrition Facts label?

©) Calories from fat are now listed in bold to emphasize their impact on health.

@ ©@ Added sugars and their percent daily value are now listed to help distinguish them from natural
sugars.

© Serving sizes are now based on recommended dietary guidelines rather than typical consumption.

© Vitamins A and C have been added as required nutrients due to common deficiencies.

That's right!

Rationale

According to the updated FDA guidelines, added sugars and their percent daily value (% DV) are now included
on the Nutrition Facts label to help consumers distinguish added sugars from naturally occurring sugars. This
change was made to address growing public health concerns about excess added sugar intake. Calories from
fat are no longer listed at all, as the type of fat is considered more relevant than the total fat calories. Serving
sizes are now based on what people typically consume—not on dietary recommendations—so labels reflect
real-world eating habits. Vitamins A and C are no longer required on labels; instead, vitamin D and potassium

are now required, based on current research about common nutrient deficiencies.

p. 212
Question 62

Which is a common sign or symptom of foodborne illnesses? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

Rash
rv) mw) Diarrhea

Wheezing

m| Vomiting

Abdominal cramping

m| Nausea

That's right!

Rationale

Common signs and symptoms of foodborne illnesses are often mistaken for the "stomach flu." Foodborne
illness may cause diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, nausea, and stomach upset. These symptoms
usually resolve in 1 to 2 days. Rash and wheezing are more likely to indicate an allergic reaction to food rather

than a foodborne illness.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 228
Question 63

A nursing assistant at a long-term care facility presents to the emergency department with
vomiting, diarrhea, and severe dehydration. The patient states, "Everyone at work is sick

with vomiting and diarrhea." Which organism could be responsible for the patient’s illness?

Cy) © Norovirus

O Salmonella
O Vibrio
O Listeria

That's right!

Rationale

Norovirus infections may occur from consuming contaminated fruits and vegetables not properly washed or
from oral-fecal transmission related to a lack of proper hand hygiene. Health care workers in long-term care
settings are at higher risk if outbreaks occur. Salmonella grows in protein-rich foods, such as milk, custard,
egg dishes, and sandwich fillings; contaminated water; and unpasteurized milk or juice. Salmonella can cause
mild-to-bloody diarrhea with fever. Vibrio is generally associated with ingestion of raw seafood. Listeria is more
common in immunocompromised patients and produces diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, headache, pneumonia,

meningitis, sepsis, and endocarditis.

p. 228
Question 64

Which of the following is most likely the cause of a Vibrio infection?

©) "Vibrio infections are usually caused by consuming undercooked meat or unpasteurized foods."
© "Vibrio infections are usually caused by fecal contamination of food due to poor hygiene."
@ ©@ " Vibrio infections are usually caused by ingesting contaminated seafood."

O "Vibrio is found in the soil, water, dust, and refuse. Raw meat and poultry transmit the infection."

That's right!

Rationale

Vibrio infections are usually caused by ingesting contaminated seafood because the bacteria requires salt
water for growth. Escherichia coli infection may be caused by consuming undercooked meats or unpasteurized
foods. Shigella infection is caused by fecal contamination of food due to poor hygiene. Clostridium perfringens
spores are found in soil, water, dust, and garbage and are frequently found in raw meat and poultry.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 225
Question 65

Which of the following food allergens requires labeling according to the Consumer

Protection Act? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Milk

™| Peanuts

Gelatin

Shellfish

™| Tree nuts

m| Food dye

So close!

Rationale

Milk, peanuts, shellfish, and tree nuts are among the eight foods that cause 90% of food allergies and
therefore must be labeled. Gelatin and food dyes can also cause allergies, but the Consumer Protection Act

does not require information about these on food labels.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 212
Question 66

Which of the following can make investigating a foodborne illness outbreak difficult?

@ © Many people attribute symptoms of a foodborne illness to the flu rather than food.

© © By the time symptoms of a foodborne illness appear, many days may have passed since the offending
item was eaten.

© Many different foods can contribute to a foodborne illness, which makes it hard to determine the
culprit.

O There is no one government agency that tracks foodborne illnesses, leading to difficulties
coordinating investigations.

So close!

Rationale

The symptoms of foodborne illnesses can mimic those associated with the flu or other temporary
gastrointestinal illnesses, and people may not seek medical care or report the issue, which makes identifying
outbreaks difficult. Symptoms of foodborne illness occur generally within 12 to 24 hours of eating the
offending item. Although many foods can cause foodborne illnesses, there are common culprits implicated in
foodborne illness outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coordinates investigations into
foodborne illness outbreaks.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

p. 228
Question 67

Based on the patient's history, which organism is likely causing this patient’s symptoms?

Patient History

Four hours ago, adult patient ate
hamburgers that were sitting outside in
the sun. Symptoms include severe
abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and
headache

© Shigella

tx} © Escherichia coli

©) Clostridium botulinum
@ © Staphylococcus aureus

So close!

Rationale

Staphylococcal food poisoning is primarily due to Staphylococcus aureus, which produces rapid illness, usually
within 1 to 6 hours after ingestion. The symptoms appear suddenly and include severe cramping and
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, usually accompanied by sweating, headache, fever, and
sometimes prostration and shock. Shigella causes shigellosis, in which symptoms usually appear 4 to 7 days
after ingestion. Most cases of infection resulting from Escherichia coli start within 2 to 8 days of ingestion.
With Clostridium botulinum, symptoms usually begin within 18 to 36 hours of ingestion and include symptoms
of nausea, vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, and slurred speech.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details. Details provided in the stem of the item, such as behavioral changes or
clinical changes (or both) within a certain time period, can provide a clue to the most appropriate response or, in

some Casé€s, responses.

pp. 224-225
Question 68

Based on the information in the patient 7 bacteria is likely causing the child’s

symptoms?

Patient History
10-month-old child playing in the dirt 3 days
ago
Symptoms started 1 day ago
® Child seems weak and will not eat
© Vomiting
© Gradual paralysis

O Escherichia coli

@ © Clostridium botulinum
©) Staphylococcus aureus
©) Clostridium perfringens

That's right!

Rationale

Clostridium botulinum is a bacterium that causes a more serious form of food poisoning; spores are found in
soil. Depending on the dose of toxin consumed and the individual response, symptoms will appear within 18
to 36 hours. Nausea, vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, and slurred speech are typical symptoms. The toxin
progressively irritates motor nerve cells and blocks the transmission of neural impulses at the nerve terminals,
thereby causing a gradual paralysis. Escherichia coli usually has symptoms of low-grade fever, stomach cramps,
and diarrhea that resolves within 7 days. Staphylococcus aureus symptoms usually appear suddenly, within 1 to
6 hours of ingestion and include nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, and sweating. Recovery is usually rapid.

Clostridium perfringens is usually found in raw meat and poultry and causes symptoms of food poisoning.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are

incorrect.

p. 227
Question 69

Which statement supports the idea of organic farming and demonstrates its benefits?

@ © Genetically modified organisms are not used in foods.
© Organically grown foods have increased nutrient value.

© ©@ Organic farming is more environmentally safe and cheaper.
© lonizing radiation is used in place of fertilizers and pesticides.

© Animals are given antibiotics to help keep the animals healthy.

So close!

Rationale

An increasing number of concerned farmers, with the help of soil scientists, are turning away from heavy
pesticide use toward alternative agricultural methods, such as organic farming. Organic plant foods grow
without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms, or ionizing radiation.
Consumers of organic foods cite that organically grown food has increased nutrient value, but that has not
been proven. Organic farming may be more beneficial for the environment but has lower crop yield, requires
more land, and is more expensive than conventionally grown crops. lonizing radiation is not used in organic
farming. Organic meat, poultry, dairy products, and eggs are from animals raised without antibiotics or
growth hormones.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

pp. 216-217
Question 70 ©

Which landmark report reinforced the need to change the food-labeling requirement to
create better food labels to maintain the health of all Americans? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| The Surgeon General’s Report on Nutrition and Health

| The National Research Council’s Diet and Health Report

| U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Research Service Report

The health and objectives defined in Healthy Peoples Initiative

The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science report

So close!

Rationale

Despite initial regulations for food labeling, a number of problems persisted, such as misleading health
claims, varying serving sizes, and vague terms. Three landmark reports that related nutrition and diet to
national health goals reinforced the need to reorganize the entire food-labeling system. Those reports were
the Surgeon General’s Report on Nutrition and Health, The National Research Council’s Diet and Health Report, and
the health and objectives defined in Healthy Peoples Initiative. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Research
Service did not create a report to reinforce the need to reorganize the food labeling system. This department
continually evaluates food and food components through its own research. The Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Science established a committee based on the other reports.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

pp. 211-212
Question 71

A patient presents with abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and fever about a week after
drinking unpasteurized milk. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan shows
inflammation confined to the large intestine. Which foodborne illness would be suspected

based on these findings?

x) © Listeriosis
rv) O Shigellosis

O Salmonellosis

O Staphylococcal food poisoning

So close!

Rationale

Shigellosis is caused by a bacteria called shigella. Symptoms usually include abdominal cramping, diarrhea,
fever, vomiting, and blood or mucus in the stool, and shigellosis is usually confined to the large intestine.
Listeriosis produces similar symptoms but is not usually confined to the large intestine. Salmonellosis also
may be demonstrated with similar symptoms but is not usually confined to the large intestine. Staphylococcal
food poisoning leads to similar symptoms as shigellosis, but is not usually confined to the large intestine.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

pp. 223-224
Question 72

The development of bloody stools and fever after drinking unpasteurized apple cider is

most likely caused by which bacterial infection?
©) Salmonella

x) © Campylobacter

rv) O Escherichia coli
O Listeria

So close!

Rationale

The nurse suspects the patient is infected with E. coli. E. coli infection can cause bloody diarrhea and fever and
sometimes progresses to renal failure and death. Most outbreaks arise from consumption of unpasteurized or
undercooked food or contaminated water. Salmonella infection is associated with the consumption of eggs,
milk, custard, sandwich fillings, shellfish, and contaminated water, producing bloody diarrhea with fever.
Campylobacter infection causes acute diarrhea and is linked to the consumption of undercooked meats and
seafood, raw milk, and untreated water. Listeria usually infects people with suppressed immunity and has been
traced to unpasteurized milk, undercooked poultry, and processed meats.

Question 73

Which statement regarding safe food preparation is correct? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) wl “I will remove and discard the outermost leaves of a head of lettuce."

will soak raw produce in water prior to peeling it."

rv) | "I will wash each lettuce leaf under running water."

will gently scrub melons so that | do not remove the outer surface."

rv) | "I will scrub fresh vegetables and fruits with a small vegetable brush."

That's right!

Rationale

Safe food preparation includes removing and discarding the outmost leaves of a head of lettuce, washing each
lettuce leaf under running water, and scrubbing fresh fruits and vegetables with a small vegetable brush.
Fruits and vegetables should be stored in the refrigerator within 2 hours of peeling or cutting. Produce should
not be soaked, because this increases the risk of contamination. Melons should be scrubbed thoroughly to
remove any contaminants.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

The food product must pass a government inspection.

rv) | The food must be made with at least 70% certified organic ingredients.

rv) | Ingredients must meet National Organic Program guidelines.

The food product may display the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Organic Seal of approval.

That's right!

Rationale

Organic foods have four labeling categories with specific guidelines for each. Products made with at least 70%
certified organic ingredients may state on the product label "made with organic ingredients" and list up to
three ingredients or food groups. These foods must also meet the National Organic Program guidelines for
growth and production without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, sewage sludge, bioengineering, or ionizing
radiation. A product must pass a government inspection if the food product is labeled as "100% organic." A
food product labeled as "made with organic ingredients" may not display the USDA Organic Seal or use it in
any advertising.

Question 76

The nurse is teaching a pregnant patient about food safety risks. Which food should the
nurse teach the pregnant patient to avoid? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Cy) | Sushi

@ [BM] Unpasteurized fruit juice
Cy) | Deli salads

Pasteurized skim milk

Whole-grain toast

@ |B] Refrigerated meat spreads

That's right!

Rationale

During pregnancy, the pregnant woman and her fetus have a higher risk of becoming sick from food
poisoning. Pregnant women should avoid rare, raw, or undercooked meats, poultry, and fish, such as sushi.
Pregnant women should also avoid unpasteurized fruit juice, milk, and vegetable juice. Deli salads (especially
those made with mayonnaise) should also be avoided. Refrigerated meat spreads and paté should not be

eaten during pregnancy. Pasteurized skim milk and whole-grain toast do not pose a food safety risk during

pregnancy.

Question 82

Which area of concern pertains to front-of-package labeling?

© Symbolic instead of text heavy
© Confusion with graded summary labeling
@ ©@ Few federal regulations for standardization

© Nutri-Score labeling not easily understood

That's right!

Rationale

Many food manufacturers use front-of-package labeling to broadcast nutrition information. Currently, there
are few federal regulations in place to standardize front-of-package labels. Ideally, front-of-package labeling
would be symbolic instead of text heavy and visually easy to interpret. Studies indicate that graded summary
labels, such as multiple traffic-light labels, Nutri-Score labels, or the 5-Color Nutrition Label, are the most well

accepted and comprehensive way to help individuals identify healthier food options.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on

Question 83

Which of the following statements regarding preparing, serving, and storing food needs

correction?

x) © "An open package of hot dogs can safely remain in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
O "An unopened package of bologna can safely remain in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks."
O "Chicken should be cooked to reach an internal temperature of 170°F or higher."

rv) O "Cool hot foods to room temperature before refrigerating.”

So close!

Rationale

The statement that needs correction is: "Cool hot foods to room temperature before refrigerating." Food does
not need to be cooled to room temperature before refrigerating; in fact, this may result in bacterial growth.
Leftovers should be refrigerated within 2 hours. An open package of hot dogs can safely remain in the
refrigerator at a temperature 40°F or lower for up to 1 week. An unopened package of bologna can safely
remain in the refrigerator at a temperature 40°F or lower for up to 2 weeks. Chicken should be cooked to an

internal temperature of 170°F or higher.

p. 233
Question 84

Which of the following helps prevent exposure to Listeria organisms during pregnancy?

@ ©@ Heat to steaming all luncheon and processed meats.
© Cook ground beef to a minimum temperature of 165°F.
©, Do not drink unpasteurized cider for the duration of pregnancy.

© Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consumption.

That's right!

Rationale

Deli meats have been implicated in Listeria infections. If a pregnant woman chooses to eat luncheon or
processed meats, they should be heated to steaming before consumption. Cooking ground beef to a
minimum temperature of 165°F and not drinking unpasteurized cider for the duration of the pregnancy help
prevent infection with Escherichia coli, not Listeria, organisms. Washing all fruits and vegetables thoroughly

before consumption helps prevent infection with Shigella, not Listeria, organisms.

p.224
Question 85

Which agency works to ensure food safety. Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.
| Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

a
m| United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
a

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)

That's right!

Rationale

The FDA works to ensure the safety of all foods except poultry and meat. The EPA works with the FDA to
ensure pesticide residues do not exceed standards. The USDA and the CDC work with the FDA to prevent the
introduction and spread of hazards and to investigate and recall food products in cases of foodborne illness.

The DHHS does not play a role in ensuring food safety.

p. 211
Question 86

Which criterion applies to health claims that link nutrients to risk for disease?

© Health claims must appear on the front of the package.
© The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve only the wording on the package.
© The health claim does not have to be approved by the FDA.

@ © A physician statement must accompany the claim and define the risk.

That's right!

Rationale
The FDA strictly regulates health claims that link nutrients or food groups with a risk for disease. A physician

statement must accompany the claim and define the risk for the disease. Health claims may appear on the
front, side, or back of the food package. To make an association between a food product and a specific disease,
the FDA must approve both the claim and the wording used on the package.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very
cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and in an area as complex
as nursing, an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a
guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number
of choices.

p.215
Question 87

Which governing body is responsible for regulating the movement of food between state

lines?
O Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

rv) © U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
O Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

O Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)

That's right!

Rationale

The EDA is charged with ensuring that the United States’ food supply is safe by enforcing food sanitation and
quality control, governing food additives, regulating the movement of foods across state lines, supervising the
nutrition labeling of foods, and ensuring the safety of public food service. The FTC regulates the advertising
and truthful marketing of food products. The CDC monitors and investigates cases of foodborne illnesses. The
Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA is responsible for food safety of both domestic and imported
meat, poultry, and processed egg products.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: [f you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about
that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie

diet).

pp. 211, 212
Question 88

When setting up a food assistance program for a community, which question is necessary
for the nurse to consider when developing program goals to address relevance?
©) Is the task realistic?

rv) © Is the goal or activity important or worth doing?
O Are standards available to assist in setting goals?

O Are sufficient resources available to complete the project?

That's right!

Rationale

Asking if the goal or activity is important or worth doing addresses relevance. Asking if the task is realistic
addresses achievability, not relevance. Asking if standards are available to assist in setting goals addresses
measurability, not relevance. Asking if sufficient resources are available to complete the project addresses

achievability, not relevance.

Question 1
—

Which meal is the largest meal of the day according to the traditional meal patterns in a
Mexican diet?

O Breakfast

O Brunch
rv) O Lunch
x) © Dinner

So close!

Rationale

Traditional meal patterns in a Mexican diet focus on lunch as the largest meal of the day, with a lighter
breakfast and dinner. Brunch is not part of a traditional meal pattern in a Mexican diet.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in
one or two of the options . Example: If the item relates to and identifies stroke rehabilitation as its focus and only
one of the options contains the word stroke in relation to rehabilitation, you are safe in identifying this choice as the
correct response.

p. 238
Question 2
a

Children’s consumption of which type of food is rarely affected by marketing influences?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Vegetables

rv) @| Fruits

Cereal

Carbonated drinks

Candies

That's right!

Rationale

Advertising strategies that use brand mascots and cartoon media characters on food packaging greatly affect
children’s eating patterns by increasing the preference for products bearing the familiar character logo.
Because fresh fruits and vegetables are not processed or packaged, they rarely include such logos. Hence their
consumption by children are rarely affected by marketing influences. Foods such as cereal, candies, and
carbonated drinks often use brand mascots and cartoon media characters on their packaging, which affects

children’s preference for these items.

p. 237
Question 3

Which is a physiologic factor that influences personal food choice?
© Available food supply

@ © Allergies

© Food technology

© Geography

That's right!

Rationale

Allergies are a physiologic factor that influences personal food choices. Available food supply, food technology,

and geography are physical factors that influence personal food choices.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: [f you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about
that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie

diet).

p. 237
Question 4

Which religious group follows the strictest observance of Jewish food laws?

O Islam
O Reform
Cy) © Orthodox

O Conservative

That's right!

Rationale

One of the three most common groups within Judaism, orthodox Jews, follow the strictest observance of
Jewish food laws. Islamic teachings guide Muslim dietary laws, not Jewish food laws. Reform Jews, one of the
three most common groups within Judaism, has less ceremonial emphasis on Jewish food laws and minimal
general use. The conservative Jews, one of the three most common groups within Judaism, are less strict in

their observance of Jewish food laws, whereas orthodox Jews follow Jewish food laws with strict observance.

p. 248
Question 5

Which food is served as a symbol of sacrifice during Eid-al-Fitr?

O Veal
Cy) © Lamb
O Pastry

O Chicken

That's right!

Rationale

At the end of Ramadan, during Eid-al-Fitr, a whole lamb is served as a symbol of sacrifice. Veal is served
during Eid-al-Fitr, but it does not represent sacrifice; it is one of the many delicacies symbolizing the joy of
returning from fasting. Rich pastries and other sweets conclude the post-Ramadan meal symbolizing the joy
of returning from fasting and the heightened sense of unity, goodwill, and charity that the fasting experience
has brought to the people. Chicken is served during Eid-al-Fitr, but it does not represent sacrifice; it is one of
the many delicacies symbolizing the joy of returning from fasting.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

United States? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

India

| China

Japan

Vietnam

Philippines

So close!

Rationale

The Asian cultural food patterns most commonly encountered in the United States have been influenced by
several countries, including India. China and Japan have influenced Asian cultural food patterns commonly
found in the United States. Some southeastern Asian countries like Vietnam and the Philippines have strongly
influenced Asian cultural food patterns commonly encountered in the United States.

Which fruit is typically found in an African-American diet? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Peaches

rv) m| Bananas

Avocado

Strawberries

rv) mw] Watermelon

That's right!

Rationale
The fruit group of the African-American population typically includes peaches, bananas, and watermelon.

Avocados are not typically consumed by African Americans. Strawberries and other berries are not usually

included in the African-American diet.

p. 242
Question &

In which way does acculturation to a Western diet affect the health and dietary intake of an
immigrant?

O Dietary intake is improved, resulting in better health overall.
O There is a decrease in the consumption of saturated fat.
rv) © New dietary habits increase the risk for chronic disease.

O Acculturation has been linked to an increased intake of vitamins and minerals.

That's right!

Rationale

Acculturation to a Western diet increases an immigrant’s risk for disease. Dietary intake is not always
improved. Acculturation has been linked to an increased risk for chronic diseases, increased consumption of
fat, decreased fiber intake, and an overall decreased intake of vitamins and minerals associated with new
dietary habits.

p. 240
Question 9

Which religion’s dietary practices prohibits or strongly discourages beef consumption?
© Eastern Orthodox Catholicism

O Islam
O Judaism
Cy) © Hinduism

That's right!

Rationale

Hindu dietary practices prohibits or strongly discourages the consumption of beef. The consumption of beef
is not prohibited in Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, and Muslim religious dietary practices.

Question 10
SE

Which food or drink is traditionally consumed at sunset to break the daily fast during

Ramadan? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Dates
Cy) m| Water
Alcohol
Coffee
Fish
So close!
Rationale

During Ramadan, Muslims all over the world fast daily by taking no food or drink from dawn until sunset.
They traditionally break the daily fast by eating an odd number of dates and having a glass of water or another
beverage. Consumption of pork and any form of alcohol is traditionally prohibited in Islam. Coffee and fish
are not the traditional foods consumed at the breaking of fast during Ramadan.

p. 249
Question 11

Which culture’s dietary pattern is often recommended by health care providers as an

effective method for cardiovascular disease prevention?
© African American

O Native American

O Puerto Rican American

rv) © Mediterranean

That's right!

Rationale

Mediterranean dietary pattern is high in heart-healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.
Individuals following a Mediterranean food pattern have a lower risk for cardiovascular disease. African-
American, Native-American and Puerto-Rican-American diets are not usually recommended by health care

providers as effective methods for cardiovascular disease prevention.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details. Details provided in the stem of the item, such as behavioral changes or
clinical changes (or both) within a certain time period, can provide a clue to the most appropriate response or, in

some Casé€s, responses.

p. 246
Question 12

Which meal pattern represents that of a traditional Mexican diet?

© Wine is served with most meals.

@ ©@ Lunch is the largest meal of the day.
©), Dinner is the largest meal of the day.
©) Soup is included with lunch and dinner.

That's right!

Rationale

Traditional meal patterns of the Mexican diet focus on lunch as the largest meal of the day, with a lighter
breakfast and dinner. Including wine with most meals is a tradition that is part of the meal pattern of Italians,
not Mexicans. Mexican Americans, not traditional Mexicans, follow the American eating patterns, which

include dinner as the largest meal of the day. The Japanese food pattern includes a bowl of soup with both

lunch and dinner; it is not a Mexican meal pattern.

p. 238
Question 13

Which hormone is responsible for making a person "feel good," giving a mild "high" by

easing the sensation of pain with pleasurable flavors?

O Testosterone

O Progesterone

rv) © Endorphin

O Estrogen

That's right!

Rationale

Certain foods, particularly sweets and other pleasurable flavors, stimulate "feel good" hormones in the brain
called endorphins that give a mild "high" that may help ease the sensation of pain. Testosterone is a male sex

hormone secreted by the testes. Progesterone and estrogen are female sex hormones.

p. 237
Question 14

Which culture introduced "soul food" during the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s?
O Native American

O French American
Cy) © African American

O Central American

That's right!

Rationale

African Americans introduced "soul food" during the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, creating wholesome
food that uses everything available. Native Americans did not develop "soul food"; their dietary pattern
depends on which food is grown locally, harvested, hunted, or fished in each region. French Americans have
contributed a unique cuisine by developing a distinctive food pattern from the available seafood and from
what they could grow and harvest; this is not considered "soul food." Central Americans did not introduce
"soul food"; their dishes center on corn, tomatoes, squashes, chilies, avocado, rice, legumes, and various fruits;

they also have Asian, European, and African influences.

p. 241
Question 15

In which way do the dietary laws of a religion direct dietary intake? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Specify who can eat food

Specify how food can be eaten

Stipulate when food can be eaten

Determine which foods should be avoided

Specify how the food should be prepared

That's right!

Rationale

The dietary laws of a religion may specify how food can be eaten, when food can be eaten, which foods should

be avoided, and how the food should be prepared. The dietary laws of religion do not specify who can eat
food.

p. 248
Question 16

Which description of food laws observed by basic groups within Judaism is correct?

O Conservative, with conditional use of food laws
Cy) © Orthodox, with strict observance of food laws
O Reform, with conditional use of food laws

©) Orthodox, with less ceremonial emphasis on food laws

That's right!

Rationale
A basic group within the religion of Judaism is the Orthodox, who practice strict observance. The remaining
groups include Conservative, with less strict observance, and Reform, with minimal general use. Reform, not

Orthodox, has less ceremonial emphasis on food laws.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

Question 17

Which feature is a characteristic of dietary pattern of Cajun cuisine? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Bland flavor

rv) m| Abundant seafood as a base

Heavy use of milk and yogurt

rv) m| Use of wine in cooking

rv) m| Use of poultry fat

That's right!

Rationale

Cajun foods have abundant seafood as a base, which is usually cooked as a stew and served over rice. Wine is
a staple for drinking and cooking for the Cajuns and French Canadians because of its French heritage. Fat
sources in traditional Cajun cooking include poultry fat. Cajun foods have strong, spicy flavors. Milk and

yogurt are not heavily used in traditional dishes.

pp. 241-242
Question 18

Which food is part of the historical dietary patterns of Native American cuisine? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Blue corn flour

Olive oil

Cy) Wild bananas

Milk

Hard cheese

rv) mw] Smoked meat

So close!

Rationale

Blue corn flour used to make cornbread and mush dumplings, wild bananas, and smoked meat are some of
the foods that are part of the historical dietary patterns of Native American cuisine. Fats that are part of the
historical dietary patterns of Native American cuisine include lard and shortening, not olive oil. Dairy products
like milk, yogurt, and cheese are not heavily used in the traditional dishes of Native Americans.

p. 239
Question 19

Which Mediterranean culture has a dietary pattern that includes plentiful portions of

vegetables frequently served as the main entrée?

rv) © Greek
O Italian

O Chinese
O Japanese

That's right!

Rationale

The Greek culture frequently serves plentiful portions of vegetables as the main entrée, although sources of
protein include lamb, chicken, and fish. Italian dishes include few high-quality ingredients; vegetables are
served by themselves, mixed in main dishes, or added to soups, sauces, and salads. China is one of the Asian

countries, not Mediterranean. Japan is an Asian country, not from the Mediterranean region.

p. 247
Question 20

Which physical factor influences personal food choices? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Available food supply

| Sanitation and housing

Advertising and marketing

@ [|B] Storage and cooking facilities

| Geography, agriculture, and distribution

So close!

Rationale

The availability of food supply is a physical factor that has an influence on personal food choices; food is
chosen according to what is available and affordable. Sanitation and housing is a physical factor that has an
influence on personal food choices; living conditions determine what food can be purchased and prepared.
Storing and cooking food is a concern for those in poor living conditions and has an influence on food
choices. The geographic area, local agriculture, and the distribution of available food have an influence on
personal food choices. Advertising and marketing is a social factor, not a physical factor, that has an influence
on personal food choices.

p. 237
Question 21

Which risk is lowered as a result of following a Mediterranean diet? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

m| Mortality

Diabetes

Cardiovascular diseases

Overall cancer incidence

Neurodegenerative diseases

That's right!

Rationale

Individuals following a Mediterranean diet have an overall lower risk for mortality, cancer, and
neurodegenerative diseases because of healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants included in the
diet. The risk for diabetes is lowered as a result of following a Mediterranean diet, and the risk for developing

cardiovascular disease is lower because the diet is high in heart-healthy mono- and polyunsaturated fats.

p. 246
Question 22

According to research, which benefit is associated with family meals? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| Lower risk for obesity in adulthood
rv] | Increased fruit and vegetable intake
rv] m| Decreased risk for disordered eating
rv] m| Improved academic performance in children
rv] | Protection against alcohol and substance use in children
I °
That's right!
Rationale

According to research, when families regularly sit down to eat meals together, there is a lower risk for obesity
in adulthood because of healthier food choices. Increased fruit and vegetable intake, and decreased intake of
unhealthy foods occur when families have meals together. When families sit down to eat meals together, there
is a decreased risk for disordered eating. Research has shown that family meals are positively associated with
improved academic performance. Family meals may be protective against alcohol and substance use among

children.

Test-Taking Tip: Answer the question that is asked. Read the situation and the question carefully, looking for
key words or phrases. Do not read anything into the question or apply what you did in a similar situation
during one of your clinical experiences. Think of each question as being an ideal, yet realistic, situation.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Hinduism

udaism

—

slam

Cy) Buddhism

Roman Catholicism

So close!

Rationale

The Hindu religious dietary practice prohibits or strongly discourages beef consumption. In the Buddhist
religion, beef is avoided by the most devout. The Jewish faith allows for the consumption of meat including
beef, but it cannot be consumed at the same time as dairy. Muslims, who practice Islam, have some
restrictions on the consumption of beef, but it is not forbidden. During Lent, Roman Catholics must avoid all
meat on Fridays, but otherwise, beef is allowed in the Catholic faith.

special value to physical and social health? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Figs

Pork

Olives

vd
Cy) Honey
vd

Alcohol

Buttermilk

So close!

Rationale

Figs and olives are mentioned in the Quran as having special value to physical and social health. According to
the Quran, honey is a food that also has special value to physical and social health. Buttermilk is mentioned in
the Quran as having special value to physical and social health. Pork is considered a haram food, which is
forbidden by Muslim dietary laws. Alcohol in any form is forbidden by Muslim dietary laws.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid spending excessive time on any one question. Most questions can be answered in 1 to

2 minutes.

p. 248
Question 25

Which food pattern differentiates Mexican American cuisine from traditional Mexican

cuisine? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Less lard is used.

| More dairy products are used.

Lunch is the largest meal of the day.

@ |B] Dinner is the largest meal of the day.

More chronic diseases are caused by poor dietary habits.

So close!

Rationale

Mexican Americans use less lard than traditional Mexicans. More dairy products are consumed by Mexican
Americans than traditional Mexicans. Mexican Americans tend to follow American eating patterns, which
include dinner as the largest meal of the day. Because of a more Americanized diet leading to poor dietary

habits, Mexican Americans are prone to develop more chronic diseases than traditional Mexicans. Traditional
Mexicans still focus on lunch as the largest meal of the day.

pp. 238-239
Question 26

Which religion abstains from consuming pork? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Islam

Rationale

Religions that abstain from pork include Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Seventh-Day Adventism. Mormons
do not restrict the consumption of pork.

p. 250
Question 27

Which food has special value for Muslims, based on the Islamic teachings of the Quran?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Figs

m| Milk

| Honey

Buttermilk

Fermented fruit

So close!

Rationale

Foods that Muslims consider to have special value based on the teachings of the Quran include figs, olives,
dates, milk, honey, and buttermilk. Fermented fruit is strictly prohibited due to the breakdown of sugars into
alcohol.

p. 248
Question 28

Which religion’s dietary practices permits leavened food with some restrictions?
© Hinduism

Cy) © Judaism
© Islam

O Mormon

That's right!

Rationale
Jewish dietary practices permit leavened food, but not during Passover. Hindu, Muslim, and Mormons dietary

practices do not have any restriction on leavened food.

p. 250
Question 29

Which feature describes the impact of changing household dynamics on food patterns?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Spending less time preparing and cooking meals

m| Eating out more frequently

Eating meals together more often

x) | Increasing the number of snacks consumed

| Increasing portion sizes

So close!

Rationale

Changing household dynamics have led people increasingly to rely on spending less time preparing and
cooking meals. They are eating out more frequently. Growing portion sizes are a concerning trend in typical
American meals and snacks. Rarely do families regularly sit down to eat meals together anymore, particularly
for breakfast and lunch. The number of snacks that Americans consume has remained relatively stable, but the
percentage of calories coming from snacks is increasing at a faster rate as compared with the increase in

calories coming from meals.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 251,p. 248
Question 30

Which food item is considered of special value to health in the Quran? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Figs

Pork

Alcohol

m| Dates

mw] Buttermilk

That's right!

Rationale

Islamic dietary law outlines foods that are permissible, called halal, based on what it is and how individuals
obtain and prepare the food. The Quran mentions certain foods as being of special value to physical and social
health, including figs, dates, and buttermilk. Foods forbidden by Islamic dietary law are haram. Haram foods

include pork and alcohol in any form.

p. 248
Question 31

Which food product can be consumed according to Jewish dietary laws? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
Pork

rv) m| Beef

m| Dairy products

Shellfish

iv)
x) mw Fish without fins and scales
iv)

m| Eggs

So close!

Rationale

Jewish dietary laws allow the consumption of meats that come from animals that chew their cud and that have
cloven hooves such as beef, dairy products, and eggs. However, kosher laws do not permit consumption of
meat and milk products at the same meal or prepared with the same dishes. Eggs can be consumed with
either dairy or meat, but eggs containing a blood spot cannot be consumed. Jewish dietary laws restrict the

consumption of pork, fish without fins and scales, and shellfish.

p. 250
Question 32

Which advertising strategy targets children and can affect their eating patterns?
©) Advertising on television

© Marketing at the grocery store
© labeling fresh fruits and vegetables

@ ©@ Using brand mascots and cartoon characters on food packages

That's right!

Rationale

Advertising strategies that use brand mascots and cartoon media characters on food packages greatly affect
children’s eating patterns by increasing the preference for products bearing the familiar character logo.
Television advertising can play a part in children’s food choices, but using mascots and cartoon characters on
food packaging are directly aimed at children. Children are not usually affected by marketing at the grocery
store because most marketing is targeted to the adult shoppers. Fresh fruits and vegetables are not processed
or packaged and rarely have any type of advertising logo.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: [f you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about

that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie

diet).

p. 237
Question 33

Which meal is acceptable for a patient in accordance with Jewish dietary laws (kashrut)?
Cy) © Chicken, rice, peas, and tea

O Shrimp, broccoli, rice, and juice
O Steak, potatoes, green beans, and milk

O Pork roast, potatoes, cabbage, and coffee

That's right!

Rationale

The meal consisting of chicken, rice, peas, and tea is acceptable for a patient following kashrut laws. Shellfish
(e.g., shrimp) are not permitted. Meat and dairy are not consumed together, so the meal consisting of steak,
potatoes, green beans, and milk is not acceptable. Pork roast, potatoes, cabbage, and coffee are not acceptable
because the consumption of pork is not permitted.

p. 250
Question 34

Which food is part of the historical dietary patterns of Native American cuisine? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Blue corn flour

That's right!

Rationale

Blue corn flour used to make cornbread and mush dumplings, wild bananas, and smoked meat are some of
the foods that are part of the historical dietary patterns of Native American cuisine. Fats that are part of the
historical dietary patterns of Native American cuisine include lard and shortening, not olive oil. Dairy products

like milk, yogurt, and cheese are not heavily used in the traditional dishes of Native Americans.

religion, beef is avoided by the most devout. The Jewish faith allows for the consumption of meat including
beef, but it cannot be consumed at the same time as dairy. Muslims, who practice Islam, have some
restrictions on the consumption of beef, but it is not forbidden. During Lent, Roman Catholics must avoid all
meat on Fridays, but otherwise, beef is allowed in the Catholic faith.

Question 38

Which food pattern differentiates Mexican American cuisine from traditional Mexican
cuisine? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) ml Less lard is used.

m| More dairy products are used.

Lunch is the largest meal of the day.

rv) m| Dinner is the largest meal of the day.

| More chronic diseases are caused by poor dietary habits.

That's right!

Rationale

Mexican Americans use less lard than traditional Mexicans. More dairy products are consumed by Mexican
Americans than traditional Mexicans. Mexican Americans tend to follow American eating patterns, which
include dinner as the largest meal of the day. Because of a more Americanized diet leading to poor dietary

habits, Mexican Americans are prone to develop more chronic diseases than traditional Mexicans. Traditional
Mexicans still focus on lunch as the largest meal of the day.

pp. 238-239
Question 39

Which traditional dietary staple is found in the Native American diet? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Rice

@| Maize

™| Beets

Question 40

Which diet change has occurred with the acculturation of Latinos living in the United

States? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

m| Poor overall diet quality

More sodium intake

a
| Intake of empty calories
a

Less fruit and vegetable intake

More compliance with the American Diabetes Association's (ADA’s) guidelines

That's right!

Rationale

The overall diet quality of accultured Latinos living in the United States has declined, according to
researchers. Increased sodium intake, increased intake of empty calories, and less fruit and vegetable intake
have occurred with the acculturation of Latinos living in the United States. Hispanic individuals who are less

accultured tend to follow dietary patterns that are more compliant with the ADA's guidelines.

Question 41

Which problem is common in individuals struggling with food insecurity? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Food neophobia

Cy) Greater health care costs

Poor attitudes about food

@ [BB] Higher rates of chronic disease

@ |B] Poor physical and mental health outcomes

So close!

Rationale

Individuals struggling with food insecurity because of their socioeconomic situation suffer from unnecessary
illness resulting in greater health care costs. Higher rates of chronic disease and poor physical and mental
health outcomes are common in individuals struggling with food insecurity. Food neophobia, a fear of new
food, is not acommon problem for individuals struggling with food insecurity. Individuals struggling with
food insecurity do not necessarily have poor attitudes about food.

p. 237
Question 42

Which factor that influences food choices is rooted in childhood experiences and has a

psychologic impact? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Food neophobia

Nutrition literacy

Health and disease status

Alcoholism and drug abuse

rv) m| Endorphins generated from comfort foods

That's right!

Rationale

Food neophobia may be a trigger for the picky eating habits of a toddler who is using food to show
independence; this may also carry over to adulthood as a fear of new food. When parents offer a "treat" to a
child as a distraction from pain or disappointment, it may carry over into adulthood and the same type of
foods trigger endorphins in the brain. Nutrition literacy is a social factor that is not rooted in childhood
experiences; it is learned throughout adulthood. Health and disease status is not rooted in childhood
experiences; health and disease are developed according to an individual’s lifestyle and eating patterns.
Alcoholism and drug abuse are social problems that develop in adolescence or adulthood; they are not rooted

in childhood experiences.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 43
I

Which physiologic factor influences personal food choices? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Nutrition literacy

Food preferences

Attitudes about food

m| Nutrient and energy needs

m| Health and disease status

That's right!

Rationale

Nutrient and energy needs and health and disease status are all physiologic factors that influence personal
food choices. Nutrition literacy is a social factor that influences food choices, not a physiologic factor. Food
preference is a psychologic, not physiologic, factor that has an influence on personal food choices. Attitudes

about food are a psychologic, not physiologic, factor that has an influence on personal food choices.

p. 237
Question 44

Which statement describes how family relationships and friendships influence personal

food habits? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] lm] Food advice is easily accepted from those who are trusted by an individual.

rv] | Individuals may turn to comfort foods from their childhood to cope with stress.

rv] m| Food is a symbol of acceptance, warmth, and friendliness in social relationships.

rv] | Food habits associated with family sentiments stay with people throughout their lives.

x) m| Family relationships determine which foods should be consumed or avoided for religious purposes.
So close!

Rationale

Food or food advice is readily accepted from friends and acquaintances and can have an influence on personal
food habits. A type of food used as a "treat" to distract a child is often recalled by the adult who will use this
comfort food to cope with stress. Food is a symbol of acceptance, warmth, and friendliness in social

relationships and can have a positive influence on personal food habits. During adulthood, certain foods may

trigger a flood of childhood memories; these triggers of family sentiments stay with people throughout their

lives. Religious dietary laws, not family relationships, determine which foods should be consumed or avoided

for religious purposes.

p. 236
Question 45

According to a biopsychosocial model, which factor influences individual food choices?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

x) m| Food neophobia

rv] | Biologic or genetically based factors

rv] mw] Environmental and societal influences

rv] m| Ethnic and regional cultural practices

rv] m| Behavioral environment, including family relationships
So close!

Rationale

A biopsychosocial model proposes that biologic or genetically based factors have a main influence on
individual food choices. Environmental and societal influences are main factors in personal food choices
according to a biopsychosocial model. Ethnic and regional cultural practices influence the establishment of
food traditions early in life, which influence individual food choices. The behavioral environment, including
family relationships, is a main influence on personal food choices, according to a biopsychosocial model. Food
neophobia is not one of the main influences on individual food choices; it is a normal developmental trait
from the evolutionary past that protected children from eating harmful foods.

p. 236
Question 46

Although there are many variations of the Mediterranean diet, which beneficial food do they

all have in common? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

High-glycemic foods

rv) m| Fatty fish and olive oil

rv) m| Nuts and whole grains

rv) | Fruits, vegetables, and legumes

Processed and packaged foods

That's right!

Rationale

Fatty fish and olive oil; nuts and whole grains; and fruits, vegetables, and legumes are beneficial foods
included in all variations of the Mediterranean diet. High-glycemic foods are not beneficial and are usually
avoided by reducing the intake of processed and packaged foods. Processed and packaged foods are usually
avoided when following a Mediterranean diet because it reduces the intake of trans fats, added sugar, and
high-glycemic foods.

p. 246
Question 47

Which recommendation about economic buying can be offered to a patient to help
promote a healthy lifestyle for all members of a family? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Avoid warehouse club stores.

Understand proper portion sizes.

Avoid all snacks that are offered in bulk.

Understand the correct way to buy in bulk.

Know how to properly store food for later use.

So close!

Rationale

Understanding proper portion size is important when planning meals and buying in bulk; often food
purchased this way has spoiled before it has been used. A patient must be educated on the correct way to
purchase food in bulk to buy the proper amount and consume it before it spoils. When purchasing in large
quantities, it is important to store food properly so that it maintains its freshness for later use. It is not
necessary to avoid warehouse stores, but the patient should be educated on how to properly plan to use large
quantities efficiently. Snack items purchased at warehouse clubs are often high in added sugars, sodium,
saturated fat, and overall calories; this should be considered but does not necessarily require all snacks to be

avoided.

p. 252
Question 48

Which food is served as the first course of the Sabbath evening meal?

TOM
© Challah
© Borscht

@ © Gefilte fish

So close!

Rationale

Gefilte fish is usually served as the first course of the Sabbath evening meal. Lox, smoked salmon, and salted
salmon are not served as the first course of the Sabbath evening meal. Challah is served at the beginning of
the Sabbath meal after the blessing over the wine and before the first course of the meal. Borscht is not served
as the first course of the Sabbath evening meal.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 248
Question 49

Which food restriction is governed by current Jewish dietary laws? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| Pork, rabbit, and birds of prey must be avoided.
rv] m| Eggs containing a blood spot cannot be consumed.
rv] m| Consumption of shellfish and crustaceans is restricted.
rv] m| Meat and milk products cannot be consumed at the same meal.
rv] m| Meat should come from animals that chew their cud and have cloven hooves.
I °
That's right!
Rationale

Under current Jewish dietary laws, pork, rabbit, and birds of prey must be avoided to follow a kosher diet.
Eggs are permitted under kosher laws, but if they contain a blood spot they should not be consumed.
Shellfish and crustacean consumption is not permitted, but kosher law allows its followers to consume fish
with fins and scales. Under current Jewish dietary laws, meat and milk products are allowed, but they cannot
be consumed together or prepared with the same dishes. Appropriate meats under kosher law should come

from animals that chew their cud and have cloven hooves.

p. 248
Question 50

When Muslims observe Ramadan, which dietary restriction is followed? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) wl! No food or drink is consumed from dawn until sunset.

rv) m| Evening breakfast takes place at sunset.

rv) mw] An odd number of dates are consumed at sunset.

Wine is consumed at sunset when the daily fast ends.

Ramadan is not observed by individuals with diabetes.

That's right!

Rationale

Ramadan is a 30-day period of a sacred fasting during daylight; no food or drink is consumed from dawn
until sunset. At sunset, the family breakfast, called the iftar, is consumed when the daily fast is broken. Before
the family breakfast, the daily fast is broken by consuming an odd number of dates and a glass of water or
other beverage. Alcohol, including wine, is forbidden by Muslim dietary laws. All Muslims past the age of
puberty, regardless of medical condition, observe the fast of Ramadan; if complications occur, such as those
that can occur with diabetes, they may abstain from the fast, but they are required to make up the days of
fasting before the next Ramadan fast.

p. 249
Question 51

Which factor has contributed to the American Indian population having the highest rates of

type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Genetics

Fast-food restaurants

Socioeconomic factors

Reliance on modern convenience and snack foods

Modern food products combined with traditional dietary staples

That's right!

Rationale

Genetic factors, which are hereditary and cannot be controlled, is one factor causing the American Indian
population to have the highest rates of type 2 diabetes. Another factor is changing dietary patterns, such as
increasing fast-food intake. Socioeconomic factors contribute to the American Indian population having the
highest rates of type 2 diabetes. An increasing reliance on modern convenience and snack foods contributes
to health concerns leading to type 2 diabetes because these foods are high in fat, sugar, calories, and sodium.
Traditional staples of American Indians, now combined with modern food products from supermarkets, is
another factor affecting the health of the American Indian population because of the reliance on unhealthy

foods.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 240
Question 52

Which change in the American household affects food patterns and overall nutrition? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| Eating out more frequently than in the past
rv] | Rising number of women in the workforce
rv] m| Less time spent on preparing and cooking meals
rv] m| Women being the primary or sole earners in 40% of households
rv] | Reliance on food items and cooking methods that save time, space, and labor
I .
That's right!
Rationale

Americans are eating out more frequently than in the past because of changing family structures and time
constraints. Unhealthy food choices may be easier and quicker for families on the run. The number of women
in the workforce has increased over the years, decreasing the time available for planning, preparing, and
cooking healthy meals. Subsequently, food is prepared and consumed outside the home and may not have the
nutrition value of a home-cooked meal. Because women are working outside the home, they have less time to
spend on preparing and cooking meals, resulting in fast-food choices or other less nutritious meals. Often,
women are the primary or sole earners in the household and may rely on meals that are less expensive, often
having less nutritional value. Food items and cooking methods that save time, space, and labor are important

for American households because of convenience; this often results in unhealthy food habits.

p. 249
Question 53

Which fact about portion sizes has raised concerns regarding Americans dining at fast-food

restaurants? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Sodium content has increased significantly.

rv) | Portion sizes of processed foods have increased.

Healthy eating patterns no longer include portion size control.

Consumers eat and drink in response to their actual hunger needs.

rv) m| Consumption of larger portions of nutrient-poor foods has increased.

That's right!

Rationale

Along with larger portion sizes, sodium content in fast-food menu items has increased significantly. Portion
sizes of processed foods have increased over the past several decades, along with increased consumption of
processed foods, leading to an unhealthy diet pattern. Consumption of larger portions of nutrient-poor foods
has increased because of changes to fast-food menu offerings and Americans dining frequently at fast-food
restaurants. Healthy eating patterns include portion size control; however, when presented with larger portion
sizes, it is more difficult to control food consumption. Most consumers continue to eat and drink relative to

the amount of food and beverage served, instead of in response to their actual hunger and energy needs.

p. 251
Question 54

Which factor is a leading cause of food insecurity for many American families? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Poverty

| High cost of healthy diet

High taxation on "junk food"

| Influence of social media

oO
x) | Limited agricultural produce
Vd

So close!

Rationale

The dietary patterns that are recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture are nutrient dense but
more costly than the typical American diet. Poverty and high cost of a healthy diet are the leading causes of
food insecurity for many American families. Limited agricultural produce and influence of social media are not
leading causes of food insecurity in America. High taxation on "junk food" is not a cause of food insecurity
either. In fact, it is expected that a high taxation on such foods will help decrease the consumption of such

foods and subsidize the cost of healthy choices.

p. 237
Question 55

Which item from the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group is commonly served as part of
African-American and Cajun cuisine? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may
be correct.

Cy) @| Grits
tx} @| Biscuits
Cush-cush

@ |B) Hushpuppies
Spoonbread

So close!

Rationale

Grits are an item from the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group that is served as part of African-American and
Cajun cuisine. Both the African-American and Cajun ethnic groups serve hushpuppies as part of their cuisine.
Biscuits are not served as part of Cajun cuisine, but they are part of African-American cuisine. Cush-cush is
only served as part of Cajun cuisine, not African-American cuisine. Spoonbread is a type of cornbread served

by African Americans, not Cajuns.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real
intent of the question.

Question 56

Which ethnic group has historically used lard as the fat in meal preparation? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) ™| Mexican

Japanese

| Caribbean

French/Cajun

vy)
Cy) Native American
iv)

mw African American

So close!

Rationale

Mexicans have historically used lard as the only fat in meal preparation. Caribbean people typically use lard in
meal preparation, along with olive and peanut oil. Native Americans use lard and shortening as the fat in meal
preparation. African Americans use lard in meal preparation, along with shortening and vegetable oils. The

Japanese use soy and rice oil, not lard, in meal preparation. French/Cajun people typically use poultry fat, not
lard, in meal preparation.

pp. 239, 241
Question 57

Which factor has resulted in reduced geographic and ethnic boundaries that have

historically preserved food cultures?

O Less time for traditional food preparation
O Dilution of traditional food patterns by younger generations
O Increased availability of various ethnic food markets and restaurants

rv) © Increased flow of technology, information, goods, and people across borders

That's right!

Rationale

Globalization and the increased flow of technology, information, goods, and people across borders have
resulted in the spread of various culture-specific elements, effectively reducing geographic and ethnic
boundaries. After the spread of culture-specific elements, lifestyle changes have provided less time for
traditional food preparation. Younger generations opting for more diverse cuisines have caused a dilution of
traditional food patterns; this is a result of the reduction of geographic and ethnic boundaries. As people have
crossed borders and brought traditions and food cultures with them, there has been an increased availability
of various ethnic food markets and restaurants; this is a result of the reduction of geographic and ethnic
boundaries, not a factor causing it.

p. 237
Question 58

Which factor has influenced changes in American food patterns? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Changes in portion sizes

Increase in family meals

rv) m| Changes in menu options

rv) m| Changes in family structure

Increase in structured mealtimes

That's right!

Rationale

Portion sizes of processed foods have increased substantially, leading Americans to overeat because serving
sizes are unnecessarily large; most consumers continue to eat and drink relative to the amount of food and
beverage served instead of in response to their actual hunger and energy needs. Fast-food menu options have
increased and are less healthy because of significant increase in energy content and sodium content; this is
problematic because of the frequency with which Americans dine at fast-food restaurants. Family structures
have changed, and women currently make up nearly 47% of the workforce in the United States; working
parents rely on food items and cooking methods that save time, space, and labor. Although research shows
that family meals have many benefits, families rarely sit down to eat meals together. Structured mealtimes

have decreased, not increased, over the past 40 years, leading in part to unhealthy snacking.

slaughter chickens on the eve of Yom Kippur, and Muslims slaughter lamb for the post-Ramadan festival.
Alcohol is discouraged or avoided by practitioners of several religions, including Seventh-Day Adventists,
Buddhists, Hindus, Mormons, and Muslims. The consumption of dairy and eggs is permitted by practitioners
of several religions, including Seventh-Day Adventists, Buddhists, Eastern Orthodox Christians, Hindus, and
Jewish. Most religions allow the consumption of meat and dairy at the same meal, but the Jewish religion

does not.

Question 72

Which feature describes the impact of changing household dynamics on food patterns?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Spending less time preparing and cooking meals

m| Eating out more frequently

Eating meals together more often

x) | Increasing the number of snacks consumed

| Increasing portion sizes

So close!

Rationale

Changing household dynamics have led people increasingly to rely on spending less time preparing and
cooking meals. They are eating out more frequently. Growing portion sizes are a concerning trend in typical
American meals and snacks. Rarely do families regularly sit down to eat meals together anymore, particularly
for breakfast and lunch. The number of snacks that Americans consume has remained relatively stable, but the
percentage of calories coming from snacks is increasing at a faster rate as compared with the increase in

calories coming from meals.

to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 73

Which food product can be consumed according to Jewish dietary laws? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
Pork

rv) m| Beef

rv) m| Dairy products

Fish without fins and scales

Shellfish

rv) m| Eggs

That's right!

Rationale

Jewish dietary laws allow the consumption of meats that come from animals that chew their cud and that have
cloven hooves such as beef, dairy products, and eggs. However, kosher laws do not permit consumption of
meat and milk products at the same meal or prepared with the same dishes. Eggs can be consumed with
either dairy or meat, but eggs containing a blood spot cannot be consumed. Jewish dietary laws restrict the

consumption of pork, fish without fins and scales, and shellfish.

Question 74
I

Which food is prohibited or strongly discouraged for Mormons? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.
Pork

Shellfish

Leavened food

rv) mw) Alcohol
iv)

| Caffeine

That's right!

Rationale
Alcohol and caffeine are prohibited or strongly discouraged for Mormons. Mormons have no restrictions on

the consumption of pork, shellfish, or leavened food.

p. 250
Question 75

When providing dietary counseling to a Hispanic patient who consumes traditional
Mexican foods, which food should the nurse consider recommending to the patient in

order to help meet the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium?
O Milk

@ © Cheese
O Yogurt

© © Low-fat milk

So close!

Rationale

When providing dietary counseling for a Hispanic patient who consumes traditional Mexican foods, the nurse
should consider recommending cheese in order to help meet the RDA for calcium. There is a high prevalence
of lactose intolerance in the Mexican population, which limits the intake of large quantities of milk products.
Cheese is a dairy food group that may be easier to tolerate and can be utilized frequently in the diet. Milk,
yogurt, and low-fat milk are less easy to tolerate and are generally not consumed in large amounts in the
Hispanic culture.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be

clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 239
Question 76

Which meal is the largest meal of the day according to the traditional meal patterns in a

Mexican diet?
O Breakfast

O Brunch
rv) © Lunch
O Dinner

That's right!

Rationale

Traditional meal patterns in a Mexican diet focus on lunch as the largest meal of the day, with a lighter
breakfast and dinner. Brunch is not part of a traditional meal pattern in a Mexican diet.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in
one or two of the options . Example: If the item relates to and identifies stroke rehabilitation as its focus and only
one of the options contains the word stroke in relation to rehabilitation, you are safe in identifying this choice as the
correct response.

p. 238
Question 77

Which country has strongly influenced Asian cultural food patterns commonly found in the

United States? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| India

China

a
| Japan
a

Vietnam

Philippines

So close!

Rationale

The Asian cultural food patterns most commonly encountered in the United States have been influenced by
several countries, including India. China and Japan have influenced Asian cultural food patterns commonly
found in the United States. Some southeastern Asian countries like Vietnam and the Philippines have strongly
influenced Asian cultural food patterns commonly encountered in the United States.

p. 242
Question 78

Which food or drink is traditionally consumed at sunset to break the daily fast during

Ramadan? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Dates

rv) m| Water
Alcohol

Coffee

Fish

That's right!

Rationale

During Ramadan, Muslims all over the world fast daily by taking no food or drink from dawn until sunset.
They traditionally break the daily fast by eating an odd number of dates and having a glass of water or another
beverage. Consumption of pork and any form of alcohol is traditionally prohibited in Islam. Coffee and fish

are not the traditional foods consumed at the breaking of fast during Ramadan.

Question 1
—

Which clinical term is used to describe a patient who has excess body fat?

Cy) O Obese

© Normal weight

© ©@ Overweight

©) Clinically obese

So close!

Rationale

As used in the traditional medical sense, obese is the clinical term for a patient who has excess body fat and is
generally used to describe people who are at least 20% above the recommended weight for height. The term
normal weight denotes a body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m *. The terms overweight and obesity are often
used interchangeably, but they technically have different meanings. Overweight denotes a body weight that is
above a population weight-for-height standard without regard to body composition. Clinically obese indicates
a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m 2.

p. 254
Question 2
—

Which personality trait is associated with clinical eating disorders?
O Histrionic
@ ©@ Impulsive

O Paranoid

O Aggressive

That's right!

Rationale
An impulsive personality is associated with clinical eating disorders. Histrionic, paranoid, and aggressive

personalities are more closely associated with other psychiatric disorders.

p. 278
Question 3
a

Which statement describes night eating syndrome?

@ ©@ The patient repeatedly consumes large amounts of food after the evening meal or upon waking from
sleep.

© The syndrome is caused by an abnormal sleep-wake cycle.
© The patient does not remember consuming food during night eating.

© The patient expresses guilt for consuming large quantities of food throughout the night.

That's right!

Rationale

The patient experiences recurrent episodes of eating after the evening meal or upon waking. The syndrome is
not caused by an abnormal sleep-wake cycle; it interferes with a normal sleep-wake cycle. The patient is aware
and can recall food consumption that occurs throughout the night. A patient with binge eating disorder
expresses guilt for consuming large quantities of food, but this is not necessarily true of a patient with night
eating syndrome.

p. 277
Question 4

Which consideration is made in the dietary treatment of an underweight patient?

© Low-protein diet
© Low-carbohydrate diet
© High intake of fats
@ ©@ Energy- and nutrient-dense diet

That's right!

Rationale

Energy- and nutrient-dense diets that are above the standard requirements are considered for underweight
and undernourished patients. High-protein and high-carbohydrates diets are considered for underweight
patients to rebuild tissues and provide the primary energy source in an easily digested form. Moderate fat, not
high intake of fat, is included in special nutrition care for underweight patients to provide essential fatty acids

and add energy without exceeding tolerance limits.

p.275
Question 5

Which feature is a characteristic of normal eating?

© Eating a fixed quantity of food daily even if not hungry
© Demonstrating very high restraint with regard to food selection
©, Recognizing that overeating and undereating are never acceptable

@ ©@ Having the ability to be flexible with an eating schedule

That's right!

Rationale
Normal eating, as opposed to disordered eating, involves having the ability to be flexible with an eating

schedule. Normal eating involves eating when hungry and stopping when full. It does not involve eating a
fixed quantity of food daily even if not hungry. Normal eating also involves demonstrating moderate restraint
with regard to food selection and recognizing that overeating and undereating are sometimes acceptable and

trusting the body to establish a balance.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

p.275
Question 6
|

Which characteristic of a weight-management program aids in lasting success? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Realistic goals

| Positive energy balance

Nutrient inadequacy

@
Cy) Cultural appeal
oO

m| Energy readjustment to maintain weight

So close!

Rationale

Realistic goals, cultural appeal, and energy readjustment to maintain weight are among the five characteristics
of a successful central dietary approach in a weight-management program. Negative energy balance, not
positive energy balance, is also a characteristic of a successful weight-management program. Nutrient
adequacy, not nutrient inadequacy, is a characteristic of a successful weight-management program.

p. 267
Question 7

Which outcome is associated with the use of body wraps as a method of weight loss?

© Major weight loss
© Burning stored calories

@ ©@ Temporary water loss
© Melting of fat mass

That's right!

Rationale
Temporary water loss is a result of using body wraps as a method of weight loss. Small weight loss, not major
weight loss, is observed with the use of body wraps. Fat mass cannot be melted away with the use of body

wraps. The burning of stored calories does not take place through the use of body wraps.

p. 265
Question &

Which factor is related to energy expenditure?
© Nutrition facts label

@ ©@ Basal metabolic rate (BMR)
© Dietary intake
© Body mass index (BMI)

That's right!

Rationale

BMR is a factor that influences energy expenditure because some people have more genetic-based metabolic
efficiency, or ability to "burn" energy more readily than others. Nutrition facts labels help individuals estimate
their caloric intake of a particular food. Dietary intake is also used to estimate the caloric intake and does not
estimate energy expenditure. BMI is used in planning diets and may be a way to categorize weight, but it is

not an energy expenditure factor.

p. 261
Question 9

Which environmental factor leads to an increase in obesity?

@ ©@ Consumption of energy-dense foods
© Consumption of nutrient-dense foods
© Increase in physical activity

O Increase in active leisure time

That's right!

Rationale
Increased consumption of energy-dense foods such as fast foods leads to an increase in obesity. Consumption

of nutrient-dense foods does not lead to increase in obesity. An increase in physical activity or active leisure

time also does not lead to an increase in obesity.

p. 261
Question 10

Which body mass index (BMI) range indicates that a patient is overweight?
CO 18.5 to 24.9

Cy) O 25 to 29.9
tx} © 30 to 35
O >35

So close!

Rationale

A BMI range of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. The normal classification is indicated by the BMI range of
18.5 to 24.9. The obese classification is indicated by the BMI range of 30 to 35. Clinically or extremely obese is
indicated by the BMI range of >35.

p. 255
|
Question 11

Which factor in determining a patient’s ideal body weight has been overlooked by health

practitioners?
rv) O Age
x) © Genetics

O Body mass index

O Waist circumference

So close!

Rationale

Until recently, health practitioners overlooked a patient’s age as an important factor for setting an ideal body
weight. A patient’s weight will usually increase with age, then decline after a certain age. Genetics is one of
several factors considered when determining a reasonable body weight for a patient. Body mass index (BMI)
has been used for decades to help clinicians determine reasonable body weights for patients. Waist
circumference helps improve accuracy when assessing a patient’s chronic disease and mortality risk.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

p. 254
Question 12

Which popular weight-loss drug was removed from the market by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) after it was discovered that one in eight patients who were using it

developed valvular regurgitation?
O Lorcaserin

© Liraglutide
© Sibutramine
@ © Fenfluramine/phentermine

That's right!

Rationale

The popular weight-loss drugs fenfluramine and phentermine ("fen—phen") were withdrawn from the market
by the FDA after patients who were using it developed valvular regurgitation, which can be fatal. In 2012, the
FDA approved the drug lorcaserin primarily for use in obese and/or patients with type 2 diabetes; it is still in
use. Sibutramine was a weight-loss drug that was removed from the market by the FDA in 2010 because of an

increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Liraglutide is a weight-loss drug approved by the FDA that is still in
use.

p. 265
Question 13

What is the impact of yo-yo dieting?
O Reduced metabolic rate and fat mass
O Increased metabolic rate and fat mass

@ ©@ Reduced metabolic rate and lean body mass

© Increased metabolic rate and lean body mass

That's right!

Rationale

Yo-yo dieting, or repeated periods of weight loss followed by weight gain, can lead to reduced metabolic rate
and lean body mass. It does not lead to reduced fat mass, increased metabolic rate, or increased lean body

mass.

p. 261
Question 14

Which behavior does the nurse expect in a patient with an eating disorder?

© Eating when hungry
@ © Adhering to a rigid eating schedule

tx} © Recognizing overeating is sometimes acceptable

© Demonstrating moderate restraint of food choices

So close!

Rationale

In a patient with an eating disorder, the nurse expects adherence to a rigid eating schedule. Normal eating
occurs when an individual has the ability to be flexible with an eating schedule. Eating when hungry,
recognizing overeating is sometimes acceptable, and demonstrating moderate restraint of food choices are all
defined as normal eating behaviors.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p.275
Question 15

Which health problem is associated with obesity and can be improved by weight loss and

maintenance of appropriate weight?
@ @ Ischemic heart disease

O Hyperthyroidism
O Bronchial asthma

O Systemic sclerosis

That's right!

Rationale

Weight loss can reduce elevated blood glucose levels and blood pressure in obese people. In turn, these
improvements reduce risks related to heart diseases such as ischemic heart disease. Hyperthyroidism,
bronchial asthma, and systemic sclerosis are not associated with obesity.

p. 258
Question 16

Which method of measuring body composition is inexpensive, portable, and easy to

perform, and does not need technical expertise?

x) © Skin-fold calipers

rv) O Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
O Air displacement plethysmography
O Hydrostatic weighing

So close!

Rationale

BIA is an easy, portable, inexpensive, and noninvasive body composition measurement tool. This method does
not require any special skill on the technician’s part. Skin fold calipers need technical expertise because the
method depends on the accuracy of locating the correct anatomical site. Air displacement plethysmography
needs a BOD POD machine, which is expensive and not portable. Hydrostatic weighing is not portable or
inexpensive.

p. 256
Question 17

In an otherwise healthy individual, which range of body mass index (BMI) would the

extremely obese fall into?

rv) O >40
x) © >35 to 39.9

O 30 to 34.9
O 25 to 29.9

So close!

Rationale

A BMI of 40 kg/m 2 or more or a BMI of 35 to 39 kg/m 2 with at least one obesity-related disorder is referred
to as extreme obesity or morbid obesity. All BMls greater than 35 kg/m 2 are not classified as extremely obese. A
BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m ? is classified as obese, not extremely obese. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m @ is classified as

overweight, not extremely obese.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary
circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 259
Question 18

Which principle of dietary modification addresses the need for reduction of about 500
keal/day?
O Realistic goals

O Cultural appeal
O Nutrient adequacy

rv) © Negative energy balance

That's right!

Rationale

The most important factor affecting weight loss is the establishment of a negative energy balance with a
reduction of about 500 kcal/day. Realistic goals for weight loss determine overall weight loss and rate of loss
but do not address the need for reduction of 500 kcal/day. Cultural appeal ensures that an individual can
maintain cultural eating patterns while losing weight, but it does not address the need for reduction of 500
kcal/day. For weight loss to be successful, it must be nutritionally adequate. Patients must consume less food

and consciously choose nutrient-dense foods. However, this does not specifically address the need for a
reduction of 500 kcal/day.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices
will seem like the correct response.

p. 267
Question 19

Which clinical term is used to describe a patient who has excess body fat?

Cy) O Obese

© Normal weight

© ©@ Overweight

©) Clinically obese

So close!

Rationale

As used in the traditional medical sense, obese is the clinical term for a patient who has excess body fat and is
generally used to describe people who are at least 20% above the recommended weight for height. The term
normal weight denotes a body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m *. The terms overweight and obesity are often
used interchangeably, but they technically have different meanings. Overweight denotes a body weight that is
above a population weight-for-height standard without regard to body composition. Clinically obese indicates
a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m 2.

p. 254
Question 20

Which characteristic of a weight-management program aids in lasting success? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Realistic goals

Positive energy balance

Nutrient inadequacy

| Cultural appeal

m| Energy readjustment to maintain weight

That's right!

Rationale

Realistic goals, cultural appeal, and energy readjustment to maintain weight are among the five characteristics
of a successful central dietary approach in a weight-management program. Negative energy balance, not
positive energy balance, is also a characteristic of a successful weight-management program. Nutrient

adequacy, not nutrient inadequacy, is a characteristic of a successful weight-management program.

p. 267
Question 21

Which cue is associated with general symptoms used to help diagnose an eating disorder?
Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
x) mw] Amenorrhea

rv) ml Cold intolerance

rv) m| Fatigue/lethargy

Epigastric discomfort

Parotid gland enlargement

x) m| Low bone mineral density

So close!

Rationale

A general sign of eating disorders is cold intolerance caused by the loss of fat tissue. Fatigue and lethargy in
eating disorders is caused by low energy intake. Other signs and symptoms are specific to the body system
they impact. Amenorrhea is related to the endocrine system. Epigastric discomfort is a symptom of
gastrointestinal problems. Parotid gland enlargement can occur as an oral and dental sign and symptom.
Because of nutritional deficiencies, low bone mineral density may occur; this is a symptom of the endocrine

system.

p. 279
Question 22

Which body mass index will concern the nurse the least?
© 17.5 kg/m ?

@ © 19.5 kg/m?
©) 25.5 kg/m ?
© 29.5 kg/m ?

That's right!

Rationale

Patients who are overweight and underweight may be experiencing malnutrition. A body mass index of 19.5
kg/m * is considered to be normal and would not cause the nurse concern. A patient with a body mass index
of 17.5 kg/m 7 is underweight. Patients with body mass indices of 25.5 or 29.5 kg/m 2 are overweight.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 255
Question 23

Which explanation describes the association between lacking the leptin receptor and severe

early-onset obesity?

rv) © No negative feedback regarding energy intake
O Difficulty losing extra fat cells gained later in life
O Reduction in metabolic rate due to high stress levels

O Significant weight gain resulting from even slight energy imbalances

That's right!

Rationale

Lacking the leptin receptor is associated with severe early-onset obesity because there is no negative feedback
regarding energy intake. It is more difficult to lose fat cells gained earlier in life. The reduction in metabolic
rate due to high stress levels is not related to lacking the leptin receptor. Significant weight gain from slight

energy imbalances can occur in healthy individuals with the leptin receptor.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 259
Question 24

Which environmental factor adds to the increasing problem of obesity in the United States?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Increased screen time

More active leisure time

Decreased portion sizes

rv) | Low-cost convenience foods

ncreased food preparation skills

That's right!

Rationale

Environmental factors adding to the increasing problem of obesity in the United States include increased
screen time, low-cost convenience foods, less active leisure time, increased portion sizes, and decreased food

preparation skills.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 258
Question 25

Which patient is most at risk for obesity?
© © Patient with leptin resistance

© Patient with ghrelin resistance
@ © Patient who performs an average of 15 minutes of physical activity daily

© Patient whose energy output exceeds intake by 100 kcal daily

So close!

Rationale

The patient who performs an average of 15 minutes of physical activity daily is most at risk for obesity. A major
contributor to obesity in Americans is physical inactivity. Walking more than 30 minutes per day can help
reduce total body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and resting heart rate. This increase in
physical activity can also improve glucose tolerance, independent of changes to dietary intake. Obesity is
associated with leptin resistance, but the exact role leptin plays in human obesity remains unclear. Ghrelin
increases appetite and adiposity, so ghrelin resistance would not put someone at risk for obesity. A patient

whose energy output exceeds intake by 100 kcal daily would likely lose weight.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in
one or two of the options .

p. 259
Question 26

A patient states to the nurse, "| cannot stop consuming large quantities of food several
times a week. | have been doing this over the past year, and | need help." Based on the

patient’s statement, which eating disorder does the nurse suspect?

O Anorexia nervosa

O Bulimia nervosa

@ ©@ Binge eating disorder
© Body dysmorphic disorder

That's right!

Rationale

Based on the patient’s statement, the nurse would suspect binge eating disorder. Binge eating disorder is a
psychiatric eating disorder characterized by the occurrence of eating excessive amounts of food at least twice a
week for a 6-month period. Anorexia nervosa results in malnourishment and starvation due to an aversion to
food or a distorted body image. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder related to a person’s fear of fatness in
which cycles of gorging on large quantities of food are followed by compensatory mechanisms to maintain a
normal body weight. Body dysmorphic disorder is a result of an obsession with a perceived defect of the body.

p. 279
Question 27

Which compensatory mechanisms would the nurse expect to be used by a patient
diagnosed with bulimia nervosa? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Laxatives

Excessive exercise

| Purging

@| Diuretics

Starvation

So close!

Rationale

A patient diagnosed with bulimia nervosa might compensate for binge eating with laxatives, excessive
exercise, purging, and diuretics. Bulimics have recurring episodes of binge eating; although they may practice
fasting, they do not starve themselves entirely, as in anorexia nervosa.

p. 277
Question 28

Which nutrition-related physical assessment finding does the nurse expect in a patient with

an eating disorder? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Dental caries

™| Menorrhagia

Heart palpitations

Gastrointestinal bleeding

| Lanugo hair

So close!

Rationale

Dental caries and heart palpations are nutrition-related clinical signs of bulimia nervosa. Dental caries is a
result of enamel erosion and can occur due to contact of the teeth with stomach acid from frequent purging.
Heart palpitations are caused by repeated episodes of vomiting, which result in dehydration and electrolyte
imbalances. Purging may also result in gastrointestinal bleeding due to irritation of the lining of the
esophagus by stomach acid and bile. Lanugo hair is associated with anorexia nervosa. Menorrhagia does not

occur with an eating disorder; on the contrary, the patient may have amenorrhea.

p. 279
Question 29

Which rationale is accurate for reestablishing a normal weight and eating pattern as a
priority in the treatment of an eating disorder?

rv) O The neurochemistry returns to normal.
O The patient is more compliant with treatment.
x) © Reestablishing a normal weight decreases the need for psychological therapy.

O Reestablishing a normal weight promotes psychological and social well-being.

So close!

Rationale

Reestablishing a normal weight and eating pattern are a priority in the treatment of an eating disorder
because neurochemistry will return to normal. Compliance with treatment is multifactorial and based on the
individual’s willingness and ability to participate in their own treatment. Psychological therapy is more
successful when neurologic disturbances are reduced. Psychological and social well-being are important, but
the main focus is on the neurochemistry returning to normal so that psychological therapy can be more
effective.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why," be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal
the correct answer.

p. 279
Question 30

Which nutritional therapy goal is appropriate for a patient with binge eating disorder?
© Eliminate episodes of purging.
© Supplement the diet for weight gain.

@ © |mplement behavioral weight loss treatment.

© Correct endocrine imbalances in the body.

That's right!

Rationale

The nutritional therapy goal appropriate for a patient with binge eating disorder is to implement behavioral
therapy to establish a healthy weight, because patients with such disorders are often overweight or obese.
Patients with binge eating disorder do not purge; purging occurs in patients with bulimia nervosa, a purging
disorder. Supplementation for weight gain is not necessary, because weight loss is a goal. Endocrine

imbalances occur most often in patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 279
Question 31

Which clinical sign is associated with eating disorders? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) M| Carotenoderma

lm) Amenorrhea

Hypertension

Calluses on the back of the hand

vd
tx} | Manic symptoms
vd

So close!

Rationale
Carotenoderma or calluses on the back of the hand are dermatologic symptoms associated with eating
disorders. Amenorrhea is an endocrine-related clinical sign associated with eating disorders. Hypotension, not

hypertension, is a symptom associated with eating disorders. Manic symptoms are not associated with eating
disorders.

p. 279
Question 32

Which criterion is assessed to diagnose a patient with bulimia nervosa? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Binge eating with lack of control while eating

rv) | Inappropriate mechanisms to prevent weight gain such as use of laxatives

rv) m| Frequency of episodes on an average of once a week for a period of 3 months

Restriction of food intake below body requirements

Repeated experience of night-eating syndrome

That's right!

Rationale

Binge eating with lack of control while eating and the use of laxatives to prevent weight gain are criteria for
bulimia nervosa diagnosis. The experience of such episodes once a week for 3 months is considered to
diagnose a patient with bulimia nervosa. The restriction of food intake below body requirements is a criterion

for anorexia nervosa. Repeated experience of night-eating syndrome is a criterion for other specified feeding

or eating disorders.

p. 277
Question 33
|

Which item is recommended in a food guide as per the principles of a sound food plan?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Red meat

Alcohol

| Lean proteins

Whole grains

m| Water

That's right!

Rationale

The overall food guide should consist of plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, while
reducing the energy density of foods eaten, with water as the ideal beverage. Red meat and alcohol are not
recommended as exchange food as per a food guide to follow a sound food plan for weight management.

p.273
Question 34

Which risk is associated with lipectomy procedures? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Anemia

rv) mw) Infection

Respiratory failure

| Large disfiguring skin depressions

Blood clots

| Circulatory problems

That's right!

Rationale

Lipectomy procedures can be painful and carry risks such as infection, large disfiguring skin depressions, and
blood clots that can lead to dangerous circulatory problems. Anemia and respiratory complications are not
risks associated with lipectomy.

p. 266
Question 35

Which effect on health is caused by a very low-calorie diet (VLCD)? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Acidosis

High blood pressure

rv) m| Electrolyte imbalance

Alkalosis

Increased basal metabolic rate (BMR)

That's right!

Rationale
Possible effects of a VLCD include acidosis and electrolyte imbalance. Other effects include low blood
pressure, not high blood pressure. Alkalosis is not caused by a VLCD. A decreased BMR is also observed

because of a calorie-deficient diet.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 36

Which characteristic is a basic principle of successful weight-loss programs? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Realistic goals

| Cultural appeal

Nutrient adequacy

Negative energy balance

m| Energy readjustment to maintain weight

So close!

Rationale

Realistic goals determine a patient’s overall weight loss and rate of loss, which are important principles of a
successful weight-loss program. Cultural appeal ensures that an individual can maintain cultural eating
patterns as they work on losing weight. For weight loss to be successful, it must be nutritionally adequate.
Patients should be consuming less food and consciously choose nutrient-dense foods. The establishment of a
negative energy balance with a reduction of about 500 keal/day is an important component of successful
weight loss; the principle consists of reduced energy in and increased energy out. Once patients have achieved
the desired weight, the kilocalorie intake must be adjusted in accordance with their maintenance needs.

p. 267
Question 37

Which aspect of the principle of energy balance is the first step in making a personalized
food plan?
O Obtain the patient’s detailed diet history.

O Have patient spread food evenly throughout the day.
rv) © Determine the current total energy needs of the patient.

O Modify patient’s energy intake and output to yield a negative energy balance.

That's right!

Rationale

Determining the current total energy needs of the patient is the first step in making a personalized food plan.
Obtaining the patient’s diet history is required before the principles of a sound food plan can be put in place;
it is not part of the principle of energy balance. Spreading food evenly throughout the day can help with
distribution balance and portion control, but it is not an aspect of energy balance. After the current total
energy needs of the patient have been determined, the energy intake and energy output can be modified to

yield a negative energy balance.

p.271
Question 38

Which medication is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in patients who
are obese and/or have type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

Cy) | Lorcaserin

tx} | Sibutramine

Phenylpropanolamine

Fenfluramine/phentermine

@ |B] Phentermine/topiramate

So close!

Rationale

In 2012, the FDA approved the drug lorcaserin primarily for use in obese and/or patients with type 2 diabetes.
Phentermine/topiramate was approved by the FDA in 2012 for use by patients who are obese and/or have type
2 diabetes. Sibutramine was a weight loss drug used for a short time before it was removed from the market
by the FDA in 2010. Phenylpropanolamine was once a popular stimulant used for weight loss but is currently
banned in the US. The popular weight loss drugs fenfluramine and phentermine were withdrawn from the
market by the FDA after patients who were using them developed valvular regurgitation, which can be fatal.

p. 266
Question 39

Which psychological factor increases a patient’s risk for obesity?

O Pregnancy
O Fast-food restaurants

© ©@ Inappropriate family food patterns
@ © Advertisements of "ideal" body types

So close!

Rationale

Advertisements of "ideal" body types are an example of a psychological risk factor for obesity because they
cultivate emotional stress in society. Pregnancy is a physiologic risk factor for obesity. Fast-food restaurants

are environmental risk factors for obesity. Inappropriate family food patterns are a family reinforcement risk
factor for obesity.

p. 261
Question 40

Which pathology is found in obesity?
©, Body mass index greater than 30 kg/m 2

@ © Enlarged fat cells
© ©@ Imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure

O Presence of a chronic health condition

So close!

Rationale
The presence of enlarged fat cells characterizes the pathology of obesity. A body mass index of greater than 30

kg/m 2, an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, and the presence of a chronic health
condition are all associated with obesity, but they are not considered part of the pathology of obesity.

p. 259
Question 41

Which eating disorder involves overeating with no compensatory behavior?

O Anorexia nervosa
O Bulimia nervosa

@ ©@ Binge eating disorder
© Other specified feeding or eating disorder

That's right!

Rationale

Binge eating disorder involves binging episodes without compensatory behaviors. This type of binge often
follows stress or anxiety as an emotional eating pattern to soothe or relieve painful or tense feelings or
experiences. Anorexia nervosa involves undereating, bulimia nervosa includes compensatory behavior
following binge eating. Other specified feeding or eating disorder lacks consistent diagnostic criteria.

p. 279
Question 42

Which cue is associated with general symptoms used to help diagnose an eating disorder?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Amenorrhea

rv) ml Cold intolerance

rv) m| Fatigue/lethargy

Epigastric discomfort

Parotid gland enlargement

Low bone mineral density

That's right!

Rationale

A general sign of eating disorders is cold intolerance caused by the loss of fat tissue. Fatigue and lethargy in
eating disorders is caused by low energy intake. Other signs and symptoms are specific to the body system
they impact. Amenorrhea is related to the endocrine system. Epigastric discomfort is a symptom of
gastrointestinal problems. Parotid gland enlargement can occur as an oral and dental sign and symptom.
Because of nutritional deficiencies, low bone mineral density may occur; this is a symptom of the endocrine
system.

p. 279
Question 43

Which patient is most at risk for obesity?
© © Patient with leptin resistance

© Patient with ghrelin resistance
@ © Patient who performs an average of 15 minutes of physical activity daily

© Patient whose energy output exceeds intake by 100 kcal daily

So close!

Rationale

The patient who performs an average of 15 minutes of physical activity daily is most at risk for obesity. A major
contributor to obesity in Americans is physical inactivity. Walking more than 30 minutes per day can help
reduce total body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and resting heart rate. This increase in
physical activity can also improve glucose tolerance, independent of changes to dietary intake. Obesity is
associated with leptin resistance, but the exact role leptin plays in human obesity remains unclear. Ghrelin
increases appetite and adiposity, so ghrelin resistance would not put someone at risk for obesity. A patient
whose energy output exceeds intake by 100 kcal daily would likely lose weight.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in
one or two of the options .

p. 259
Question 44

Which compensatory mechanisms would the nurse expect to be used by a patient
diagnosed with bulimia nervosa? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@| Laxatives

| Excessive exercise

| Purging

Diuretics

Starvation

So close!

Rationale

A patient diagnosed with bulimia nervosa might compensate for binge eating with laxatives, excessive
exercise, purging, and diuretics. Bulimics have recurring episodes of binge eating; although they may practice
fasting, they do not starve themselves entirely, as in anorexia nervosa.

p. 277
Question 45

Which nutrition-related physical assessment finding does the nurse expect in a patient with

an eating disorder? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Dental caries

Menorrhagia

| Heart palpitations

Gastrointestinal bleeding

m| Lanugo hair

That's right!

Rationale

Dental caries and heart palpations are nutrition-related clinical signs of bulimia nervosa. Dental caries is a
result of enamel erosion and can occur due to contact of the teeth with stomach acid from frequent purging.
Heart palpitations are caused by repeated episodes of vomiting, which result in dehydration and electrolyte
imbalances. Purging may also result in gastrointestinal bleeding due to irritation of the lining of the
esophagus by stomach acid and bile. Lanugo hair is associated with anorexia nervosa. Menorrhagia does not

occur with an eating disorder; on the contrary, the patient may have amenorrhea.

p. 279
Question 46

Which rationale is accurate for reestablishing a normal weight and eating pattern as a
priority in the treatment of an eating disorder?

rv) O The neurochemistry returns to normal.
O The patient is more compliant with treatment.
x) © Reestablishing a normal weight decreases the need for psychological therapy.

O Reestablishing a normal weight promotes psychological and social well-being.

So close!

Rationale

Reestablishing a normal weight and eating pattern are a priority in the treatment of an eating disorder
because neurochemistry will return to normal. Compliance with treatment is multifactorial and based on the
individual’s willingness and ability to participate in their own treatment. Psychological therapy is more
successful when neurologic disturbances are reduced. Psychological and social well-being are important, but
the main focus is on the neurochemistry returning to normal so that psychological therapy can be more
effective.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why," be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal
the correct answer.

p. 279
Question 47

Which clinical sign is associated with eating disorders? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

rv) | Carotenoderma

rv) mw] Amenorrhea

Hypertension

Manic symptoms

rv) | Calluses on the back of the hand

That's right!

Rationale

Carotenoderma or calluses on the back of the hand are dermatologic symptoms associated with eating
disorders. Amenorrhea is an endocrine-related clinical sign associated with eating disorders. Hypotension, not
hypertension, is a symptom associated with eating disorders. Manic symptoms are not associated with eating

disorders.

p. 279
Question 48

Which characteristic is a basic principle of successful weight-loss programs? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] | Realistic goals
rv] | Cultural appeal
rv] m| Nutrient adequacy
rv] m| Negative energy balance

Question 49

Which physiologic, psychologic, or social factor can contribute to malnutrition in older

adults? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] | Taste changes
rv] | Social problems
rv] | Gastrointestinal problems
rv] | Drug-nutrient interactions
rv] m| Body composition changes
I °

That's right!

Rationale

Taste changes can affect food intake and contribute to malnutrition in older adult patients. Social problems,
like a sense of isolation, can lead to decreased food intake and malnutrition. Delayed gastric emptying can
cause abdominal distention and lack of appetite, leading to malnutrition. Many prescribed and over-the-
counter (OTC) medications cause anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, and some can cause nutrient
malabsorption, leading to malnutrition. Changes in body composition can cause eating difficulties because of

decreased fluid status and xerostomia, which can contribute to malnutrition.

p. 276
Question 50

Having a body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m 2 can lead to which health condition?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Diabetes mellitus

rv) m| Lowered resistance to infection

rv) | Poor overall health

ncreased cholesterol

rv) m| Decreased strength

That's right!

Rationale

A body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m “is considered underweight. People who are underweight can have
a lowered resistance to infection, poor overall health, and decreased strength. Diabetes mellitus and increased
cholesterol are health conditions associated with being overweight.

p.275
Question 51

Which extreme practice is the most successful method of permanent weight loss for

patients with severe obesity?
O Body wrapping

rv) © Bariatric surgery

O Weight-loss drugs
O Very low-calorie diet

That's right!

Rationale

Historically, the most successful extreme method of permanent weight loss for patients with severe obesity is
bariatric surgery. The procedure provides significant and sustained weight loss and reduces relative risk for
death by decreasing co-morbid diseases. Body wraps are used to attempt to reduce body size, but the small
weight loss is caused by temporary water loss. There are many weight-loss drugs on the market, but many
have been removed from the market. Any drug must be used under careful supervision because it can have
dangerous health consequences. The drastic approach of a very low-calorie diet requires medical supervision
and can have deleterious effects on a patient’s health. When normal eating is resumed, the patient will gain

back more fat mass than was initially lost.

p. 266
Question 52

Which hormone is an appetite stimulant?
O Leptin

@ @ Ghrelin
O Secretin

© Cholecystokinin

That's right!

Rationale
Ghrelin is an appetite stimulant secreted from the stomach to activate the appetite-regulating network. Leptin
controls satiety by serving as a negative feedback mechanism against the overconsumption of total energy.

Secretin stimulates gastric and pancreatic secretions. Cholecystokinin inhibits gastric motility and stimulates
pancreatic secretions and bile.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 259
Question 53

Which risk is associated with a body fat percentage that is below the recommended range?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Low bone mineral density

Amenorrhea

Abdominal organ dysfunction

iV]
Cy) M| Increased risk for fractures
°

™| Decreased athletic performance

So close!

Rationale

Sometimes athletes and dancers strive for body fat levels below the recommended range. Low body fat
percentages may put athletic women at risk for low bone mineral density associated with amenorrhea .
Increased risk for fractures, including stress fractures, is also a concern. A high percentage of visceral fat is
associated with abdominal organ dysfunction, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, and
hemorrhoids. The body fat percentage associated with increased athletic performance may not be the best

level for all-around long-term health.

p. 279
Question 54

Which is a modifiable risk factor that can cause obesity? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Leptin

Genetic predisposition

| Physical inactivity

Body fat percentage

| Family food patterns

So close!

Rationale
While educating the family, the nurse should include physical inactivity, body fat percentage, and family food

patterns as modifiable risk factors and instruct the family to develop healthy eating habits and increase
physical activity. Leptin is a hormone that predisposes individuals to obesity. Leptin and genetic predisposition
are not modifiable risk factors for obesity.

p. 259
Question 55

Which reason explains why weight-loss fad diets fail? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

rv) | They are often nutritionally inadequate and based on false claims.

m| The degree of energy restriction is impossible to maintain long term.

Fast and convenient foods may cost less than energy-dense foods.

rv) | Individuals are led to believe that weight loss is easy and effortless.

lm] They fail to address the necessity of changing long-term habits and behaviors.

That's right!

Rationale

Weight-loss fad diets fail because they are often nutritionally inadequate and based on false claims, setting
individuals up for failure. The degree of energy restriction required by some fad diets is impossible to
maintain long term. Books and supplements sell briefly and then fade away because the quick fixes either do
not work or are not sustainable; individuals who try these fads are led to believe that weight loss is easy and
effortless. People are often set up for failure regarding the maintenance of healthy weight because they fail to
address the necessity of changing long-term habits and behaviors. Fast and convenient foods may cost less
than energy-dense foods, but this is not a cause of fad diet failure. Rather, it is an environmental factor that

adds to the ever-increasing problem of obesity.

p. 261
Question 56

Which principle is associated with a sound food plan? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.
rv) ml A food guide

A careful diet history

m| A preventative approach

Energy and nutrient balance

| Distribution balance and portion control

So close!

Rationale

A food guide for reference is important when developing a sound food plan. It provides comparative food
values and portions, variety in food choices, and basic meal planning. A preventative approach is an important
part of a sound food plan because prevention of excess weight gain is the most effective means of healthy
weight management. Energy and nutrient balance are requirements of a sound food plan. Energy intake and
output modifications can be used for weight loss, while nutrient balance can determine the proper basic diet
components. Distribution balance and portion control is essential when developing a sound food plan
because it assists patients with planning meals and snacks throughout the day and helps them control their
intake. The patient’s diet history should be obtained before the food plan is constructed.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real
intent of the question.

p.271
Question 57

Which food fad claim considers all processed foods unhealthy?
©) Food cures

Cy) © Natural foods

O Harmful foods

O Food combinations

That's right!

Rationale

The natural foods claim describes unprocessed or minimally processed products as "natural" foods and states
that only these can meet the body’s needs and prevent disease. The claim may lead a patient to believe that all
processed foods are unhealthy, including those that are enriched or fortified. Food cures claim that certain
foods can treat, if not cure, specific conditions, which is not necessarily true. The claim focuses on the food
itself rather than the specific nutrients in the food. Some individuals are allergic to specific foods and should
avoid them, but the claim of harmful foods suggests that certain foods cause harm if eaten regardless of
allergies. Claims about food combinations suggest that certain combinations of foods can restore health and
are effective for weight loss; however, it does not consider all processed foods unhealthy.

p.273
Question 58

Which negative effect is associated with erroneous claims of food fads? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

High cost

| Misinformation

Danger to health

| Failure to seek medical care

Rejection of food production

So close!

Rationale

Although some foods and supplements are harmless health-wise, the financial cost can be high for a "miracle
cure" if that money could have been used for nutritious foods that would fulfill a patient’s basic nutritional
needs. Misinformation hinders the development of individual and society, and ignores scientific progress,
counteracting sound teaching about health. Fraudulent claims can mislead ill and anxious people to postpone
proven effective therapy and fail to seek appropriate medical care, putting them in danger. Erroneous claims

can cause people to distrust the food market and reject all modern food production.

p.273
Question 59

Which goal must be addressed at the beginning of eating disorder treatment?
O Continuing support groups
© Restoring healthy eating habits

@ ©@ Establishing a healthy weight for the patient

© Working to heal intrapersonal and interpersonal problems

That's right!

Rationale

The first goal for patients being treated for an eating disorder is to establish a healthy weight. Support that
includes friends, family, health care professionals, and other patients is critical for long-term treatment of an
eating disorder. The support should continue beyond the initial treatment. Healthy eating habits must be
restored to optimize a patient’s physical and mental health, but this occurs once a patient has achieved a
healthy weight. Healing intrapersonal and interpersonal problems addresses the possible psychologic
disorders that can accompany eating disorders, but this work must be done after a patient’s weight has been
restored.

p. 279
Question 60

Which dietary need must be met for underweight and undernourished patients to increase
energy and nutrient intake? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| High protein

Moderate fat

High carbohydrate

| Nutrient-dense diet

| Vitamin sources

So close!

Rationale

Underweight and undernourished patients need to consume a diet that is high in protein to rebuild tissue
and increase energy and nutrient intake. Moderate fat in the diet is needed to provide essential fatty acids and
add energy. Carbohydrates provide the primary energy source in a form that is easily digested and are
essential to increase energy in underweight and undernourished patients. A nutrient-dense diet, above the
standard requirements for a patient’s age and sex, is essential for people who are underweight and
undernourished. Vitamins and minerals must be provided by a variety of nutrient-dense foods and dietary

supplements, if necessary.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 275
Question 61

Which condition causes patients to experience general malnutrition and be underweight?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

m| Wasting disease

Poor food intake

Malabsorption

Hormonal imbalance

Low energy availability

Poor living situation

That's right!

Rationale

Wasting is a long-term disease with chronic infection and fever that raises the basal metabolic rate (BMR). It
can cause malnutrition and lead patients to become underweight. Psychologic factors that cause a patient to
refuse to eat or socioeconomic factors like limited access to food can also lead to malnutrition and weight
loss. Gastrointestinal problems like chronic diarrhea, gastrointestinal disease, excessive use of laxatives, or
drug-nutrient interactions can cause malabsorption and a patient becoming underweight. Hormone
imbalances like hyperthyroidism increase the body’s caloric needs; if these needs are not met, malnutrition
can result, and a patient can become underweight. Inadequate energy intake relative to energy needs occurs
from greatly increased physical activity without a corresponding increase in food, or the lack of available food
supply. Patients who live in a home with inadequate and infrequent meals can become underweight and
malnourished.

p.275
Question 62

Which patient has an increased risk for health complications related to excess body fat?

Cy) © Male with a 42-in waist circumference
O Male with a 39-in waist circumference
O Female with a 34-in waist circumference

O Female with a 30-in waist circumference

That's right!

Rationale

Men who have a waist circumference of 40 in or greater have an increased risk for health complications
related to excess body fat. The male patient with a 42-in waist circumference is therefore at an increased risk
for health complications. The man with the 39-in waist does not have an increased risk for health
complications related to excess body fat. Women who have a waist circumference of 35 in or greater have an
increased risk for health complications related to excess body fat, so the woman with the 34-in waist and the
woman with the 30-in waist do not have an increased risk.

p. 254
Question 63

Which sociocultural influence is a risk factor for eating disorders?

O Anxiety
tx} © Perfectionism

O Serotonin disturbance
Cy) O Thin-ideal internalization

So close!

Rationale

The sociocultural influence that has contributed to eating disorders is thin-ideal internalization. Media
exposure to idealization of thinness, perceived pressure for thinness, and thin-ideal internalization are all
sociocultural influences that have been identified as risk factors for eating disorders. Anxiety and
perfectionism are personality traits linked to eating disorders. Serotonin disturbance affects the

neurocognitive process and is not a sociocultural influence for eating disorders.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 278
Question 64

Which characteristic is found in a patient with the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Low self-esteem

rv) m| Dieting behavior

Use of diuretics

rv) | Perfectionism

Self-induced vomiting

That's right!

Rationale

Characteristics of anorexia nervosa include low self-esteem, dieting behavior, and perfectionism. Anorexia
nervosa is a psychophysiologic aversion to food and distorted body image that results in life-threatening
weight loss. The dieting behavior of an anorexic consists of minimal nutritional intake that results in
malnutrition and starvation. Perfectionism is a personality trait associated with anorexia nervosa. The use of

diuretics and self-induced vomiting are characteristics of bulimia nervosa.

p. 278
Question 65

Which strategy can help reduce drug-nutrient interactions for older patients in long-term

care facilities?

O Increase in physical activity

O Use of nutrient-dense foods
rv) O Constant medical, nutrition, and nursing attention

x) © Feeding assistance provided by sensitive nursing care

So close!

Rationale

Drug therapy for older patients should involve constant medical, nutritional, and nursing attention to avoid
the direct and indirect causes of drug-nutrient interactions. An increase in physical activity is recommended, if
possible, to avoid the decline of lean body mass caused by body composition changes; however, this does not
reduce drug-nutrient interactions. The use of nutrient-dense foods does not reduce drug-nutrient
interactions, but it can help with body composition changes. Feeding assistance provided by sensitive nursing
care can help older patients who have difficulty with eating because of functional disabilities, but it does not

reduce drug-nutrient interactions.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in
one or two of the options . Example: If the item relates to and identifies stroke rehabilitation as its focus and only
one of the options contains the word stroke in relation to rehabilitation, you are safe in identifying this choice as the

correct response.

p. 276
Question 66

Which advice will the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) give to a patient post—weight

loss surgery to avoid complications like dumping syndrome? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Determine portion size.

| Develop an eating plan.

Maintain physical activity.

| Avoid consuming fluid with food.

Decrease simple carbohydrate intake.

So close!

Rationale

After weight loss surgery, the RDN needs to counsel the patient about determining portion size and
developing an eating plan to avoid complications like dumping syndrome. Maintaining physical activity after
weight loss surgery will help lead to long-term weight loss success and therefore reduce complications by
helping reduce weight effectively. Avoiding consuming fluid with food is another way to avoid complications
like dumping syndrome. Decreasing simple carbohydrate intake will also help avoid complications and should
be included in postsurgery counseling by the RDH.

p. 266
Question 67

Which positive teaching approach is useful when discussing claims about diets,
supplements, and other nutrition-related fads? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Cy) | Use well-known community resources.

| Recognize the emotional need for food.

Have the patient use the Internet for research.

Cy) | Present sound nutrition and health information.

| Use the Food and Nutrition Science Alliance as part of patient teaching.

That's right!

Rationale

Sharing well-known, sound, community resources with patients is one positive approach to providing
education about various diets, supplements, and nutrition-related fads. The emotional needs that food and
food rituals help to fulfill are part of life, and they can be positive influencers in nutrition teaching. Presenting
sound nutrition and health information from reliable sources can help to educate the patient about the
validity of any claims discussed. The Food and Nutrition Science Alliance’s 10 Red Flags of Junk Science is a
helpful tool to disseminate sound nutrition information as opposed to nutrition-related fads. Although
Internet research can be useful, it is important to provide the patient with reliable sources of positive

information about sound nutrition and health.

Test-Taking Tip: Have confidence in your initial response to an item because it more than likely is the correct

answer.

p.274
Question 68

Which strategy must be addressed before beginning a program of personal behavior
modification for weight management? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

@ [BH] Managing eating behavior

Developing a preventative approach

| Balancing energy intake and energy output

Pursuing emotional, social, and psychologic health

| Promoting physical activity to increase energy output

So close!

Rationale

A successful program of personal behavior modification for weight management focuses on management of
the patient’s eating behavior. This can involve using a food diary to document when, why, where, and how
much food is consumed. Keeping track can help patients become aware of poor eating habits. The pursuit of
emotional, social, and psychologic health helps patients focus on the goals developed for the weight-
management program. An important component is stress management. Physical activity to increase the
patient’s energy output must be addressed. The patient must be aware of changes that need to be made to
their activity level for successful weight loss to be supported. Developing a preventative approach is not a
strategy addressed before beginning a behavior modification program; it is one of the principles of a sound
food plan. Balancing energy intake and energy output is one of the basic principles of dietary modification. It

occurs after personal behavior modification has been established.

Rationale
While educating the family, the nurse should include physical inactivity, body fat percentage, and family food

patterns as modifiable risk factors and instruct the family to develop healthy eating habits and increase
physical activity. Leptin is a hormone that predisposes individuals to obesity. Leptin and genetic predisposition
are not modifiable risk factors for obesity.

Question 71

Which principle is associated with a sound food plan? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.
rv) ml A food guide

A careful diet history

rv) m| A preventative approach

rv) m| Energy and nutrient balance

Distribution balance and portion control

That's right!

Rationale

A food guide for reference is important when developing a sound food plan. It provides comparative food
values and portions, variety in food choices, and basic meal planning. A preventative approach is an important
part of a sound food plan because prevention of excess weight gain is the most effective means of healthy
weight management. Energy and nutrient balance are requirements of a sound food plan. Energy intake and
output modifications can be used for weight loss, while nutrient balance can determine the proper basic diet
components. Distribution balance and portion control is essential when developing a sound food plan
because it assists patients with planning meals and snacks throughout the day and helps them control their
intake. The patient’s diet history should be obtained before the food plan is constructed.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real
intent of the question.

p.271
Question 72

Which negative effect is associated with erroneous claims of food fads? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] mm) High cost

rv] mw! Misinformation

rv] m| Danger to health

rv] | Failure to seek medical care
rv] | Rejection of food production

That's right!

Rationale

Although some foods and supplements are harmless health-wise, the financial cost can be high for a "miracle
cure" if that money could have been used for nutritious foods that would fulfill a patient’s basic nutritional
needs. Misinformation hinders the development of individual and society, and ignores scientific progress,
counteracting sound teaching about health. Fraudulent claims can mislead ill and anxious people to postpone
proven effective therapy and fail to seek appropriate medical care, putting them in danger. Erroneous claims

can cause people to distrust the food market and reject all modern food production.

p.273
Question 73

Which dietary need must be met for underweight and undernourished patients to increase
energy and nutrient intake? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

| High protein

Moderate fat

High carbohydrate

Nutrient-dense diet

Vitamin sources

That's right!

Rationale

Underweight and undernourished patients need to consume a diet that is high in protein to rebuild tissue
and increase energy and nutrient intake. Moderate fat in the diet is needed to provide essential fatty acids and
add energy. Carbohydrates provide the primary energy source in a form that is easily digested and are
essential to increase energy in underweight and undernourished patients. A nutrient-dense diet, above the
standard requirements for a patient’s age and sex, is essential for people who are underweight and
undernourished. Vitamins and minerals must be provided by a variety of nutrient-dense foods and dietary

supplements, if necessary.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p.275
Question 74

Which sociocultural influence is a risk factor for eating disorders?

O Anxiety

O Perfectionism
O Serotonin disturbance

Cy) © Thin-ideal internalization

That's right!

Rationale

The sociocultural influence that has contributed to eating disorders is thin-ideal internalization. Media
exposure to idealization of thinness, perceived pressure for thinness, and thin-ideal internalization are all
sociocultural influences that have been identified as risk factors for eating disorders. Anxiety and
perfectionism are personality traits linked to eating disorders. Serotonin disturbance affects the

neurocognitive process and is not a sociocultural influence for eating disorders.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 278
Question 75

Which strategy can help reduce drug-nutrient interactions for older patients in long-term

care facilities?

O Increase in physical activity

O Use of nutrient-dense foods
rv) © Constant medical, nutrition, and nursing attention

O Feeding assistance provided by sensitive nursing care

That's right!

Rationale

Drug therapy for older patients should involve constant medical, nutritional, and nursing attention to avoid
the direct and indirect causes of drug-nutrient interactions. An increase in physical activity is recommended, if
possible, to avoid the decline of lean body mass caused by body composition changes; however, this does not
reduce drug-nutrient interactions. The use of nutrient-dense foods does not reduce drug-nutrient
interactions, but it can help with body composition changes. Feeding assistance provided by sensitive nursing
care can help older patients who have difficulty with eating because of functional disabilities, but it does not

reduce drug-nutrient interactions.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in
one or two of the options . Example: If the item relates to and identifies stroke rehabilitation as its focus and only
one of the options contains the word stroke in relation to rehabilitation, you are safe in identifying this choice as the

correct response.

p. 276
Question 76

Which advice will the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) give to a patient post—weight
loss surgery to avoid complications like dumping syndrome? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

| Determine portion size.

Develop an eating plan.

Maintain physical activity.

Avoid consuming fluid with food.

Decrease simple carbohydrate intake.

That's right!

Rationale

After weight loss surgery, the RDN needs to counsel the patient about determining portion size and
developing an eating plan to avoid complications like dumping syndrome. Maintaining physical activity after
weight loss surgery will help lead to long-term weight loss success and therefore reduce complications by
helping reduce weight effectively. Avoiding consuming fluid with food is another way to avoid complications
like dumping syndrome. Decreasing simple carbohydrate intake will also help avoid complications and should
be included in postsurgery counseling by the RDH.

p. 266
Question 77

Which medication is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in patients who
are obese and/or have type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

Cy) | Lorcaserin

Sibutramine

Phenylpropanolamine

Fenfluramine/phentermine

@ |B] Phentermine/topiramate

That's right!

Rationale

In 2012, the FDA approved the drug lorcaserin primarily for use in obese and/or patients with type 2 diabetes.
Phentermine/topiramate was approved by the FDA in 2012 for use by patients who are obese and/or have type
2 diabetes. Sibutramine was a weight loss drug used for a short time before it was removed from the market
by the FDA in 2010. Phenylpropanolamine was once a popular stimulant used for weight loss but is currently
banned in the US. The popular weight loss drugs fenfluramine and phentermine were withdrawn from the
market by the FDA after patients who were using them developed valvular regurgitation, which can be fatal.

p. 266
Question 78

Which psychological factor increases a patient’s risk for obesity?

O Pregnancy
O Fast-food restaurants

© Inappropriate family food patterns
@ ©@ Advertisements of "ideal" body types

That's right!

Rationale

Advertisements of "ideal" body types are an example of a psychological risk factor for obesity because they
cultivate emotional stress in society. Pregnancy is a physiologic risk factor for obesity. Fast-food restaurants
are environmental risk factors for obesity. Inappropriate family food patterns are a family reinforcement risk
factor for obesity.

p. 261
Question 79

Which pathology is found in obesity?
©, Body mass index greater than 30 kg/m 2

@ ©@ Enlarged fat cells
© |mbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure

O Presence of a chronic health condition

That's right!

Rationale
The presence of enlarged fat cells characterizes the pathology of obesity. A body mass index of greater than 30

kg/m 2, an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, and the presence of a chronic health
condition are all associated with obesity, but they are not considered part of the pathology of obesity.

p. 259
Question 80

Which behavior does the nurse expect in a patient with an eating disorder?

© Eating when hungry
@ ©@ Adhering to a rigid eating schedule

O Recognizing overeating is sometimes acceptable

© Demonstrating moderate restraint of food choices

That's right!

Rationale

In a patient with an eating disorder, the nurse expects adherence to a rigid eating schedule. Normal eating
occurs when an individual has the ability to be flexible with an eating schedule. Eating when hungry,
recognizing overeating is sometimes acceptable, and demonstrating moderate restraint of food choices are all

defined as normal eating behaviors.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p.275
Question 81

Which method of measuring body composition is inexpensive, portable, and easy to

perform, and does not need technical expertise?
O Skin-fold calipers

rv) © Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
O Air displacement plethysmography
O Hydrostatic weighing

That's right!

Rationale

BIA is an easy, portable, inexpensive, and noninvasive body composition measurement tool. This method does
not require any special skill on the technician’s part. Skin fold calipers need technical expertise because the
method depends on the accuracy of locating the correct anatomical site. Air displacement plethysmography

needs a BOD POD machine, which is expensive and not portable. Hydrostatic weighing is not portable or
inexpensive.

p. 256
Question 82

In an otherwise healthy individual, which range of body mass index (BMI) would the

extremely obese fall into?

0 ® >40

O >35 to 39.9
O 30 to 34.9
O 25 to 29.9

That's right!

Rationale

A BMI of 40 kg/m 2 or more or a BMI of 35 to 39 kg/m 2 with at least one obesity-related disorder is referred
to as extreme obesity or morbid obesity. All BMls greater than 35 kg/m 2 are not classified as extremely obese. A
BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m ? is classified as obese, not extremely obese. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m @ is classified as

overweight, not extremely obese.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary
circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 259
Question 83

Which body mass index (BMI) range indicates that a patient is overweight?
CO 18.5 to 24.9

Cy) © 25 to 29.9
O 30 to 35
O >35

That's right!

Rationale

A BMI range of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. The normal classification is indicated by the BMI range of

18.5 to 24.9. The obese classification is indicated by the BMI range of 30 to 35. Clinically or extremely obese is
indicated by the BMI range of >35.

Question 1
—

Which factor is important when using a sports drink to supplement fluid loss?

© ©@ Water is the best solution for regular needs.
©) Delay using a sports drink until symptoms of dehydration appear.
©) The extent of dehydration will determine if a sports drink is appropriate.

@ © ‘Select a sports drink that has optimal gastric emptying and intestinal absorption times.

So close!

Rationale

When using a sports drink to supplement fluid loss, it is important to select one that has optimal gastric
emptying and intestinal absorption times in order for it to be most effective. Water is the best solution for
regular needs, but athletes who are engaged in longer and demanding endurance events may benefit from a
sports drink. Fluid-replacement strategies should be implemented during exercise to prevent the symptoms
of dehydration. It is difficult to measure the extent of dehydration; it is appropriate to use a sports drink
before symptoms of dehydration are evident.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the

material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 290
Question 2
a

Which method can be used to calculate basic energy needs?

© Kilocalories per hour

© Peak oxygen uptake

Cy) © Cunningham equation
© Target heart rate

That's right!

Rationale

The Cunningham equation is one method used to calculate basic energy needs. Kilocalories per hour is used
to calculate energy expenditure, not energy needs. Peak oxygen uptake assists in determining the intensity
and duration of exercise that a person can perform. Target heart rate is used to determine the appropriate

heart rate to maximize aerobic benefits of exercise.

p. 290
Question 3
a

According to Healthy People 2020, adults should perform muscle-strengthening activities at

least how many days per week?
Ol

TOR:

O®>
Q7

So close!

Rationale

Adults should perform moderate- or high-intensity muscle-strengthening activities that involve all major
muscle groups at least twice a week because these activities provide additional health benefits. Once a week is
not enough. Five and seven times per week are more than necessary.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very

cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and an absolute may be a
reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken

to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices.

p. 283
Question 4

Which type of exercise creates and maintains muscle and bone strength?
© Activities of daily living
© Aerobic exercise

Cy) © Resistance training
© Weight-bearing exercise

That's right!

Rationale

Resistance training creates and maintains muscle and bone strength. Activities of daily living do not reach
aerobic levels but should still be incorporated into daily life. Aerobic exercises can be sustained at a necessary
level of intensity to provide aerobic benefits. Weight-bearing exercises are important for bone structure and
strength. In these exercises, muscles are working against gravity, but they do not create muscle and bone

strength.

p. 287
Question 5

Which macronutrient is the main source of energy for exercise?

© Fatty acids

@ ©@ Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale

Carbohydrates are the chief macronutrient for energy support throughout exercise because they are the only
available energy source for anaerobic fuel. Fatty acids serve as a fuel source from dietary intake and adipose
tissue, but they are not the main source of energy. Water is not classified as a macronutrient. Protein makes a
relatively insignificant and inefficient contribution to energy during exercise under normal circumstances.

p. 289
Question 6

Which measure of protein is required for endurance and strength-trained athletes?

© 0.6 to 0.7 g/kg/day

© 0.8 to 0.9 g/kg/day

© Ito 1.1 g/kg/day
@ @ 1.2 to2 glkg/day

That's right!

Rationale

The protein requirement of endurance and strength-trained athletes is 1.2 to 2 g/kg/day. Protein intake of less
than 1.2 to 2 g/kg/day is not sufficient for protein turnover and metabolic adaptation required for endurance
athletes.

p. 291
Question 7
|

Deficiency of which macronutrient or micronutrient is associated with limited sun exposure

in athletes?

rv) © Vitamin D
O lron

O Dietary fat
O Dietary protein

That's right!

Rationale
Lack of vitamin D is seen in indoor athletes or athletes with limited sun exposure. Deficiencies of iron, dietary

fat, and dietary protein are not associated with limited sun exposure.

p. 292
Question &

When building aerobic capacity, the level of exercises should raise the pulse to which

percentage of an individual's maximum heart rate?
O 10% to 30%

O 35% to 45%

x) © 45% to 55%
rv) O 60% to 90%

So close!

Rationale

To build aerobic capacity, the level of exercise must raise the pulse to 60% to 90% of an individual’s maximum

heart rate. Raising the pulse to a lower rate will not aid in building aerobic capacity.

p. 288
Question 9

Which minimum level of physical activity is recommended for an adult to obtain substantial
health benefits?

O 45 minutes per day of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity
O 100 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity
rv) © 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity

O 175 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity

That's right!

Rationale

One hundred and fifty minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, or 75 to 150 minutes
a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, is the minimum recommended amount of exercise for
an adult. Forty-five minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per day is equal to 315 minutes a week, almost
double the minimum recommendation. One hundred minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical
activity is less than the minimum level of physical activity recommended. One hundred and seventy-five

minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity is above the recommended minimum level of activity.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details. Details provided in the stem of the item, such as behavioral changes or
clinical changes (or both) within a certain time period, can provide a clue to the most appropriate response or, in

some Casé€s, responses.

p. 283
Question 10

Which type of exercise strengthens the heart muscle?
O Yoga
© Stretching

O Resistance training

@ © Aerobic conditioning

That's right!

Rationale

Aerobic conditioning is an excellent exercise to strengthen the heart muscle, enabling it to pump more
efficiently. Yoga is a flexibility activity that typically does not raise the heart rate to a level that increases aerobic
capacity. Stretching is a flexibility activity that typically does not raise the heart rate to a level that increases
aerobic capacity. Resistance training is a muscle strengthening activity that is not considered an aerobic
activity.

p. 284
Question 11

When developing physical activity recommendations and benefits, which consideration best
meets the overall national health goal?

O Weekly balance training for all adults.
rv) © Increased participation in regular physical activity.
O Muscle-strengthening activities on every day of the week.

O Vigorous-intensity aerobic activity on one day of the week.

That's right!

Rationale

Increased participation in regular physical activity is the overall national health goal, encouraging adults to
move more and sit less. Balance training is recommended for older adults, along with aerobic and muscle-
strengthening activities. The recommendation for muscle-strengthening activities is dependent on the age
group. Vigorous-intensity aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week, and the amount is

dependent on the age group.

p. 282
Question 12

What is the definition of amenorrhea?

© Sporadic menstrual cycles occurring three to nine times a year.
© Cramps and pelvic pain during the menstrual cycle.
@ @ The cessation of previously regular menses for 3 months.

© The repression of all menstrual cycles until 15 years of age.

That's right!

Rationale

Amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of previously regular menses for 3 months. Sporadic menstrual cycles
occurring three to nine times a year is called oligomenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is the term for painful menstrual
cycles involving cramps and pelvic pain. Primary amenorrhea is the repression of all menstrual cycles until 15

years of age.

p. 293
Question 13

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans is based on which three components?

O Intensity, age, duration
O Frequency, duration, age

@ ©@ Intensity, frequency, duration
©) Duration, frequency, type of activity

That's right!

Rationale
The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans is based on intensity, frequency, and duration. The fourth

component is sets and repetitions, specific to muscle strengthening. Specific age groups have different
guidelines regarding types of exercises.

p. 282
Question 14

Which hour-long activity will result in the most energy expended?
© ©@ Circuit training, moderate effort

© Mountain bicycling
@ © Swimming at a vigorous level
© High-impact aerobics

So close!

Rationale

Swimming at a vigorous level will result in the most energy expended with 686 kcal per hour. Moderate circuit
training will expend 300 kcal per hour. Mountain bicycling will expend 595 kcal per hour. High-impact
aerobics will expend 420 kcal per hour.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the

material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 288
Question 15

How many grams of carbohydrates are needed for high-intensity or endurance exercise

lasting more than 1 hour?

So close!

Rationale

For activities lasting 1 hour or less, most athletes do not require dietary sources of energy during the exercise
period. However, performance is enhanced during longer endurance or higher-intensity events with the
interval consumption of carbohydrates. For high-intensity or endurance exercise lasting more than 1 hour, 30
to 60 g of carbohydrates per hour are recommended. Approximately 1 to 4 g of carbohydrates per kilogram of
body weight is recommended for a pregame meal. Endurance athletes need 7 to 10 g of carbohydrates per
kilogram of body weight per day. For ultra-endurance events longer than 2.5 hours, up to 90 g of
carbohydrate per hour may be needed.

p. 291
Question 16

Which measure of carbohydrate is needed daily by athletes undergoing endurance training?
© 3 to 4 g/kg of body weight
© @ 5 to 6 g/kg of body weight

@ © 7 to 10 g/kg of body weight
© 12 to 14 g/kg of body weight

So close!

Rationale
The daily carbohydrate requirement for endurance athletes is 7 to 10 g/kg of body weight per day. 3 to 7 g/kg

body weight carbohydrate intake per day is enough for general training. Ultra-endurance athletes require
carbohydrates up to 12 g/kg body weight per day.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 291
Question 17

Which type of athlete converts stored fat for energy?
© ©@ Untrained athletes

Cy) O Trained endurance athletes
© Athletes with lean body mass

© Athletes who cannot meet energy needs

So close!

Rationale

The use of stored fat for energy during exercise depends on the level of fitness and the intensity of the
exercise; therefore trained endurance athletes are more efficient at using fat for energy than are untrained
athletes. Lean body mass influences a person’s fitness level and oxygen use and is efficient in the use of all
nutrients. Athletes who cannot meet appropriate energy needs should choose a well-balanced diet with
adequate calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients; stored fat is not the first energy source in this
situation.

p. 289
Question 18

Which fuel source is predominantly used by the body when maximal oxygen uptake (VO

2max) exceeds 65%?

rv) O Carbohydrate
x) © Fat
O Proteins

O Vitamins and minerals

So close!

Rationale

As intensity of exercise increases, or exceeds approximately 65% VO 2max, carbohydrate becomes the
predominant fuel source and fat contributes less. Proteins, vitamins, and minerals are not the predominant
fuel source for high-intensity exercises.

p. 289
Question 19

Which factor is important when using a sports drink to supplement fluid loss?

© Water is the best solution for regular needs.
©) Delay using a sports drink until symptoms of dehydration appear.
©) The extent of dehydration will determine if a sports drink is appropriate.

@ ©@ Select a sports drink that has optimal gastric emptying and intestinal absorption times.

That's right!

Rationale

When using a sports drink to supplement fluid loss, it is important to select one that has optimal gastric
emptying and intestinal absorption times in order for it to be most effective. Water is the best solution for
regular needs, but athletes who are engaged in longer and demanding endurance events may benefit from a
sports drink. Fluid-replacement strategies should be implemented during exercise to prevent the symptoms
of dehydration. It is difficult to measure the extent of dehydration; it is appropriate to use a sports drink
before symptoms of dehydration are evident.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the

material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 290
Question 20

Which definition describes energy availability?

© The tendency to increase work or exercise capacity and output
© Millimeters of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body weight per minute
© Moderate and gradual tapering of exercise while increasing carbohydrate intake

@ ©@ The amount of dietary energy remaining after subtracting the energy required for exercise training

That's right!

Rationale

Energy availability is defined as the amount of dietary energy remaining after subtracting the energy required
for exercise training. Various substances that increase work or exercise capacity and output are called
ergogenic aids. Millimeters of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body weight per minute as influenced by
body composition is referred to as aerobic capacity. Moderate and gradual tapering of exercise while
increasing carbohydrate intake is a practice called carbohydrate loading, which occurs the week before an
athletic event.

p. 292
Question 21

Which modality is the primary treatment for the female athlete triad?
© Restore body weight.

@ © Address the cause of low energy availability.
© © Adjust dietary intake, and modify exercise training.

O Educate trainers, athletes, and health professionals.

So close!

Rationale

The primary treatment for the female athlete triad is to address the underlying cause of low energy
availability. Restoration of body weight is an effective way to support resumption of menses and improve bone
health, but this is not the primary treatment. Adjusting dietary intake and modifying exercise training can help
to normalize energy status after addressing the cause of low energy availability. The need to educate trainers,
athletes, and health professionals about the consequences of neglected nutrition is important but is not the
primary treatment for the female athlete triad.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 293
Question 22

Which factor determines fluid needs for athletes? Select all that apply.One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

| Body size and composition

Preexercise hydration status

Fitness level and metabolic rate

Intensity and duration of exercise

Temperature, altitude, and humidity

That's right!

Rationale

Fluid needs for athletes depend on body size and composition, preexercise hydration status, fitness level, and
metabolic rate. Intensity and duration of exercise also determine fluid needs, as does the surrounding

temperature, altitude, and humidity.

p. 290
Question 23

Which body component requires more fuel than others?

@ ©@ Lean body mass

That's right!

Rationale

Lean body mass is more metabolically active and requires more fuel than other body tissues. Lean body mass
requires more fuel than fat. Lean body mass requires more fuel than bone. Lean body mass requires more fuel
than water.

p. 289
Question 24

A 65-year-old patient weighing 150 Ib would like to begin an aerobic exercise program.

Calculate the maximal heart rate for this patient to achieve aerobic benefits. Record answer

using a whole number. @) 128 @| 155 beats/min

So close!

Rationale

The maximum heart rate for a 65-year-old patient is 155 beats/min. The maximal heart rate is calculated by
subtracting the patient’s age (65) from 220.

220 — 65 = 155. (It is not necessary to know the patient’s weight to calculate maximal heart rate.)

Test-Taking Tip: When taking the NCLEX examination, an on-screen calculator will be available for you to
determine your response, which you will then type in the provided space.

p. 288
Question 25

To which patient will the nurse most likely recommend carbohydrate loading?

© Asprinter running in the 100-meter dash
© Awvrestler participating in a state final
@ ©@ Arunner ina long-distance track meet

© A diabetic participating in a walking club

That's right!

Rationale

A runner in a long-distance track meet will benefit from carbohydrate loading, which is typically
recommended for continuous exercise lasting 90 minutes or more. The sprinter and the wrestler are
participating in sports of a short duration, which will not necessarily benefit from carbohydrate loading. A
diabetic should not use carbohydrate loading due to its effects on glucose regulation.

Test-Taking Tip: Have confidence in your initial response to an item because it more than likely is the correct

answer.

p. 293
Question 26

Wall climbing is considered which type of physical activity?

@ © Muscle fitness
©) Flexibility
© Aerobic

© ©@ Lifestyle

So close!

Rationale

Muscle fitness activities focus on resistance. Wall climbing is an example of this type of activity. Flexibility
activities, such as yoga, focus on stretching. Aerobic activities, such as running, increase heart rate. Lifestyle
physical activities are of moderate intensity, such as playing golf.

p. 284
Question 27

Which side effect is seen with the use of ergogenic aids? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Gynecomastia

Hepatitis

Hypertrophy of the testicles

@ |B] Decreased production of sperm

MM Increased risk for atherosclerosis

So close!

Rationale

Gynecomastia is a known side effect of using ergogenic aids. Hepatitis, decreased production of sperm, and
increased risk for atherosclerosis are also side effects of using anabolic steroids. Atrophy of the testicles is a

side effect of using ergogenic aids, not hypertrophy.

p. 295
Question 28

Which factor influences the fluid needs of an athlete? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

| Adequate nutrition of the individual

Individual’s fitness level

The surrounding temperature

The individual’s metabolic rate

Pre-exercise hydration status

So close!

Rationale

Adequate hydration is an important consideration for athletes. Fluid needs depend on the following: (1) the
intensity and duration of the exercise, (2) the surrounding temperature, altitude, and humidity, (3) the
individual’s fitness level, body size and composition, and metabolic rate, and (4) pre-exercise hydration status.

The nutrition level of the individual does not influence their fluid needs.

Question 29

Which component is part of the female athlete triad? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

rv) m| Low energy availability

rv) m| Menstrual dysfunction

rv) m| Low bone mineral density

Disturbance in immunity

Disturbance in cardiovascular health

That's right!

Rationale

The female athlete triad is the medical condition comprising three interrelated components faced by
physically active women: (1) low energy availability with or without disordered eating, (2) menstrual
dysfunction, and (3) low bone mineral density. Disturbances in immunity and cardiovascular health are not
part of the triad. They are associated with relative energy deficiency of sports, which identifies impaired
physiologic functioning resulting from low energy availability in both male and female athletes.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 30

Which effect is observed with a low-carbohydrate diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Fatigue

| Ketoacidosis

Respiratory alkalosis

oO
@ |B] Decreased capacity for work
oO

Dehydration

So close!

Rationale

Physically active individuals following low-carbohydrate diets are susceptible to fatigue, ketoacidosis, a
decreased capacity for work, and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis is not an effect of low-carbohydrate diets.

p. 291
Question 31

Which statement regarding fluid needs is true? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

rv) | Fluid status directly affects the body’s ability to distribute oxygen and nutrients to working muscle
cells.

@ [BB] Dehydration of 2% or more of one’s body weight will impair athletic performance.
Fluid-replacement strategies implemented during exercise may worsen cramps.

@ |B] Individuals who are engaged in longer and demanding endurance events may benefit from the
consumption of electrolytes.

@ |B] Continued dehydration may lead to delirium.

I .
That's right!
Rationale

Blood is primarily water; thus fluid status directly affects the body’s ability to distribute oxygen and nutrients

to working muscle cells. Dehydration of 2% or more of one’s body weight will impair athletic performance,

particularly in hot and humid climates. Athletes who are engaged in longer and demanding endurance events

(i-e., more than 60 to 90 minutes), especially in a warm environment, may benefit from a sports drink

(containing electrolytes and glucose) that has optimal gastric emptying and intestinal absorption times.

Continued dehydration is known to cause delirium. Fluid-replacement strategies implemented during

exercise may prevent, not worsen, cramps.

p. 290
Question 32

Which physiologic change that improves cardiovascular health occurs with regular physical

activity? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Increase in cardiac output

ncrease in cholesterol levels

rv) m| Lower triglyceride levels

rv) | Increase in oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood

ncrease in the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol

That's right!

Rationale

Regular physical activity has many benefits, including increased cardiac output. Regular physical activity also
lowers triglyceride levels in the blood and increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. These effects
reduce the risk for coronary heart diseases. Regular physical activity decreases cholesterol levels. It decreases,

not increases, the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

p. 284
Question 33

Which recommendation is included in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Children aged 3 to 5 years should be physically active throughout the day.

Engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity
aerobic activity in adults can be harmful.

@ [BB] Children and adolescents age 6 to 17 years should engage in 60 minutes or more of physical activity
each day.

| Older adults should determine their level of effort of physical activity relative to their level of fitness.

ll As part of weekly physical activity, older adults should focus their physical activity on bone
strengthening.

So close!

Rationale

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that children age 3 to 5 years should be physically
active throughout the day. It is also recommended that children and adolescents age 6 to 17 years should
engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day. Older adults should determine their level of effort
of physical activity relative to their level of fitness. Engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300
minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity in adults provides additional and more-extensive
health benefits and is not harmful. It is recommended that older adults focus on physical activity that includes

balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, but not bone strengthening.

pp. 282-283
Question 34

Which type of athlete may benefit from iron supplementation?
@ ©@ Individuals with anemia

O Females with low bone mass
O Females with amenorrhea

© Individuals with disordered eating patterns

That's right!

Rationale

Therapeutic iron supplements may be necessary for some individuals who are experiencing iron-deficiency
anemia. Females with low bone mass are in danger of developing osteoporosis, but iron supplementation
would not be beneficial. Iron supplementation is not beneficial for females with amenorrhea; they need
assessment of their nutrient-energy status. Disordered eating patterns may include low calcium, protein and
energy intake and may eventually lead to a deficiency in other nutrients, but iron supplementation is not
necessary unless anemia occurs.

p. 292
Question 35

The nurse is encouraging a 40-year-old patient who weighs 260 Ib to begin an aerobic

exercise program. Calculate the target heart rate for this patient to achieve aerobic benefits.

Record answer in a whole number. @| 180 @| 126 beats/min

So close!

Rationale
A 40-year-old patient who weighs 260 Ib should have a target heart rate of 126 beats/min. To calculate the

target heart rate to achieve aerobic benefits of exercise, the nurse would subtract the patient’s age from the
maximum heart rate: 220 - 40 = 180. Next, the nurse would multiply the difference by 70% to determine the

target heart rate: 180 x 0.7 = 126. (It is not necessary to know the patient’s weight to calculate target heart
rate.)

pp. 288-289
Question 36

In which way can weight-bearing exercise have a destructive effect on bone density?

© Osteoblast activity is increased.
© Calcium deposits are decreased.
© Osteoporosis risk is increased.

@ ©@ Bone density can be lost by overtraining or undernutrition.

That's right!

Rationale

Excessive forms of training can have a destructive effect, in which bone density is lost due to overtraining or
undernutrition or both. Exercise increases osteoblast activity, which helps to strengthen bones. Calcium
deposits are increased, not decreased, with weight-bearing exercise. Weight-bearing exercise reduces the risk

for osteoporosis by increasing bone density.

p. 288
Question 37

Which modality is the primary treatment for the female athlete triad?
© Restore body weight.

@ ©@ Address the cause of low energy availability.
© Adjust dietary intake, and modify exercise training.

O Educate trainers, athletes, and health professionals.

That's right!

Rationale

The primary treatment for the female athlete triad is to address the underlying cause of low energy
availability. Restoration of body weight is an effective way to support resumption of menses and improve bone
health, but this is not the primary treatment. Adjusting dietary intake and modifying exercise training can help
to normalize energy status after addressing the cause of low energy availability. The need to educate trainers,
athletes, and health professionals about the consequences of neglected nutrition is important but is not the
primary treatment for the female athlete triad.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 293
Question 38

A 65-year-old patient weighing 150 Ib would like to begin an aerobic exercise program.

Calculate the maximal heart rate for this patient to achieve aerobic benefits. Record answer

using a whole number. @

That's right!

Rationale

155

beats/min

The maximum heart rate for a 65-year-old patient is 155 beats/min. The maximal heart rate is calculated by

subtracting the patient’s age (65) from 220.

220 — 65 = 155. (It is not necessary to know the patient’s weight to calculate maximal heart rate.)

Test-Taking Tip: When taking the NCLEX examination, an on-screen calculator will be available for you to

determine your response, which you will then type in the provided space.

p. 288
Question 39

Wall climbing is considered which type of physical activity?

Cy) © Muscle fitness
© Flexibility
O Aerobic

© Lifestyle

That's right!

Rationale
Muscle fitness activities focus on resistance. Wall climbing is an example of this type of activity. Flexibility
activities, such as yoga, focus on stretching. Aerobic activities, such as running, increase heart rate. Lifestyle

physical activities are of moderate intensity, such as playing golf.

p. 284
Question 40

Which side effect is seen with the use of ergogenic aids? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Gynecomastia

| Hepatitis

Hypertrophy of the testicles

rv) m| Decreased production of sperm

ml Increased risk for atherosclerosis

That's right!

Rationale

Gynecomastia is a known side effect of using ergogenic aids. Hepatitis, decreased production of sperm, and
increased risk for atherosclerosis are also side effects of using anabolic steroids. Atrophy of the testicles is a
side effect of using ergogenic aids, not hypertrophy.

p. 295
Question 41

Which factor influences the fluid needs of an athlete? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Adequate nutrition of the individual

Individual’s fitness level

The surrounding temperature

The individual’s metabolic rate

Pre-exercise hydration status

That's right!

Rationale

Adequate hydration is an important consideration for athletes. Fluid needs depend on the following: (1) the
intensity and duration of the exercise, (2) the surrounding temperature, altitude, and humidity, (3) the
individual’s fitness level, body size and composition, and metabolic rate, and (4) pre-exercise hydration status.

The nutrition level of the individual does not influence their fluid needs.

Which effect is observed with a low-carbohydrate diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

rv) | Fatigue

| Ketoacidosis

Respiratory alkalosis

oO
rv) m| Decreased capacity for work
oO

m| Dehydration

That's right!

Rationale

Physically active individuals following low-carbohydrate diets are susceptible to fatigue, ketoacidosis, a
decreased capacity for work, and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis is not an effect of low-carbohydrate diets.

p. 291
Question 43

Which consideration is associated with planning a pregame meal to incorporate

carbohydrate loading? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

The meal should be low in fat and fiber.

he meal should contain a high amount of protein.

he meal should provide a sufficient amount of fluid.

he meal should be consumed 24 hours before the event.

T
T
The meal should contain a moderate amount of protein.
T
T

he meal should contain an appropriate amount of carbohydrate.

So close!

Rationale

A pregame meal should include low amounts of fat and fiber. A sufficient amount of fluid in the pregame
meal helps with digestion and absorption. Moderate amounts of protein can be included in the pregame
meal. The pregame meal should provide a sufficient amount of carbohydrate (approximately 1 to 4 g of
carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight). Protein slows the rate of emptying in the stomach and should only
be included in low to moderate amounts. The pregame meal should be consumed 2 to 4 hours before the

event, not 24 hours before the event.

p. 294
Question 44

Which step is involved in a 7-day carbohydrate-loading protocol to prepare for an

endurance event? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Increase total carbohydrate intake.

Consume a high-carbohydrate preevent meal.

a
m| Perform moderate and gradual tapering of exercise.
a

Complete rest on day 6 before the event.

Promote absorption of carbohydrates by reducing fluid intake.

That's right!

Rationale

To prepare for an endurance event, total carbohydrate intake should be increased. A high-carbohydrate meal
should be eaten just before the event. Carbohydrate loading involves moderate and gradual tapering of
exercise on days 1 through 5 before the event. Complete rest on day 6 before the event is recommended

during the process of carbohydrate loading. Adequate fluid intake is required during carbohydrate loading.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

pp. 293-294
Question 45

Which pathology may become evident at the clinical end of the spectrum of the female

athlete triad? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) lm) Amenorrhea

Osteoporosis

Eating disorders

| Health problems, such as cardiac arrhythmias

oO
@ [BM] Low energy availability
@

So close!

Rationale

Amenorrhea is one of the pathologies identified at the clinical end of the spectrum of the female athlete triad.
Loss of bone mineral density can lead to osteoporosis, which becomes evident at the clinical end of the
spectrum of the female athlete triad. Low energy availability, with or without disordered eating, is evident at
the clinical end of the spectrum of the female athlete triad. Eating disorders are sometimes a factor leading to
further problems, but they are not always evident. Serious health problems, such as cardiac arrhythmias, may
occur if an eating disorder is present, but they are not always evident at the clinical end of the spectrum of the
female athlete triad.

Question 46

In which way can an athlete following a vegetarian diet expect to meet their increased

nutrient needs? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] | Obtain specific nutrition education.

rv] | Use an intentional, thought-out meal plan.

x) m| Supplement with iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, and vitamin D.

rv] m| Consume plant-based protein sources throughout the day.

rv] | Consult a sports dietitian to determine any nutrient areas of concern.
So close!

Rationale

An athlete following a vegetarian diet may benefit from specific nutrition education to learn how to properly
meet their nutrient needs. An intentional, thought-out meal plan can help the athlete to meet their increased
nutrient needs. A balanced vegetarian diet that includes a variety of plant-based protein sources consumed
consistently throughout the day can easily meet the protein needs of all active individuals. A sports dietitian
can assess a vegetarian athlete’s diet to identify any deficiencies or specific nutrients of concern. Depending
on the degree of dietary restrictions, supplementation may be considered, but a sports dietitian should assess
the diet for any specific nutrients of concern before beginning supplementation.

p. 292
Question 47

Which performance supplement shows ergogenic potential but requires further research
before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding its use? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@| Carnitine

Probiotics

Food polyphenols

Omega-3 fatty acids

Sodium bicarbonate

So close!

Rationale

Carnitine is an equivocal performance supplement that plays a critical role in energy production, but
additional research is needed to substantiate potential ergogenic effects. Probiotics show ergogenic potential
but require further research before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding their use. Food
polyphenols like quercetin, curcumin, and anthocyanin show ergogenic potential but require further research
before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding their use. Omega-3 fatty acids show ergogenic
potential but require further research before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding their use.
Sodium bicarbonate is an established performance supplement that helps to reduce fatigue associated with
high-intensity exercise.

p. 296
Question 48

Which established performance supplement provides a better response to untrained
individuals than trained individuals? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may

be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Nitrate

| Caffeine

@| Creatine

Beta-alanine

Sodium bicarbonate

So close!

Rationale

It appears that trained individuals have less of a response to nitrate supplementation compared with
untrained individuals. Beta-alanine may reduce fatigue, particularly in untrained individuals. Caffeine has
established performance benefits that assist trained and untrained individuals. Creatine loading can have
acute performance benefits in both trained and untrained individuals, particularly for athletes in weight-class
sports or endurance sports. Sodium bicarbonate reduces the fatigue associated with high-intensity exercise
and can benefit trained and untrained individuals.

p. 296
Question 49

Which physiologic side effect can occur when anabolic steroids are taken in megadoses?

Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Hypomania

Mood swings

Gynecomastia

Liver abnormalities

Atrophy of testicles

Increased risk for atherosclerosis

So close!

Rationale

When athletes take anabolic steroids in megadoses, masculinization and gynecomastia can occur. Liver
abnormalities, such as dysfunction, tumor, and hepatitis, can occur when anabolic steroids are taken in
megadoses. Atrophy of the testicles and decreased sperm production are also physiologic side effects of
megadoses of anabolic steroids. Increased risk for atherosclerosis is another physiologic side effect of taking
anabolic steroids in megadoses. Hypomania is a psychologic effect, not a physiologic side effect, of taking
anabolic steroids in megadoses. Mood swings are a psychologic effect that can occur when megadoses of
anabolic steroids are taken.

p. 295
Question 50

For high-intensity or endurance exercise lasting more than 1 hour, which recommendation
would be appropriate for nutrition during exercise? Select all that apply.One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

90 g of carbohydrate per hour

| 15 to 25 g of high-quality protein

| 30 to 60 g of carbohydrate per hour

| Equal amounts of food or drink at regular intervals

Simple carbohydrates with little or no fat, protein, or fiber

So close!

Rationale

For high-intensity or endurance exercise lasting more than 1 hour, recommendations include consuming 30
to 60 g of carbohydrate per hour, equal amounts of food or drink at regular intervals throughout the exercise,
and simple carbohydrates with little or no fat, protein, or fiber. For high-intensity or endurance exercise
lasting more than 2.5 hours, individuals may need up to 90 g of carbohydrate per hour. Although 15 to 25 g of
high-quality protein will maximize muscle protein synthesis in the recovery stage, it is not recommended
during exercise.

p. 294
Question 51

Which problem can occur for physically active individuals who consume too few

carbohydrates? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Fatigue

| Ketoacidosis

iv)
rv) m| Dehydration
iv)

Weight loss

| Poor performance

That's right!

Rationale

Physically active individuals following low-carbohydrate diets are susceptible to fatigue. Ketoacidosis can
occur in physically active individuals who consume too few carbohydrates. Physically active individuals who
consume too few carbohydrates are susceptible to dehydration. Diets that are too low in carbohydrates are
unable to meet energy demands and result in poor performance. Weight is maintained by the intake of fat,
not carbohydrates.

p. 291
Question 52

Which condition may result from the extreme demands placed on the bodies of athletes

involved in heavy training? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Injury

Infection

Exhaustion

Malnutrition

| Dehydration

So close!

Rationale

Failure to meet the increased energy and fluid needs required for heavy training demands can cause the
athlete to be susceptible to injury. The extreme demands on the body render athletes more susceptible to
immunosuppression and infection. Fatigue and exhaustion can occur if adequate energy is not provided
during prolonged exercise. Exercise-induced malnutrition can occur if adequate calories, macronutrients, and
micronutrients are not provided. Excessive sweating during heavy training can lead to dehydration if fluid-
retention strategies are not implemented during exercise.

p. 290
Question 53

Which factor is important for achieving aerobic benefits? Select all that apply.One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

Always use a personal trainer.

Exercise for 150 minutes per week.

Exercise at 70% of the maximal heart rate.

Check the pulse before, during, and after exercise.

Use a heart monitor to keep track of the heart rate.

So close!

Rationale

Achieving aerobic benefits requires a total of 150 minutes of exercise per week. Achieving aerobic benefits
requires exercise to be performed at 70% of the maximal heart rate. The pulse should be checked before,
during, and after exercise to monitor progress toward the target heart rate and aerobic capacity. Although
seeking advice and guidance from a certified personal trainer is helpful, it is not necessary to always use a
personal trainer. Heart rate monitors are a convenient way to keep track of the heart rate, but their use is not

necessary.

p. 288
Question 54

Which mental health benefit can be obtained by exercise? Select all that apply.One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

| Pain is decreased.

Mood is improved.

Sleep quality is improved.

Bone density is increased.

Stress management is improved.

Cardiovascular disease risk is lowered.

So close!

Rationale

Exercise stimulates the production of endorphins that decrease pain and improve mood. As individuals age,

stress. Weight-bearing exercise increases bone density, but this affects the skeletal system, not mental health.

Exercise lowers the risk for cardiovascular disease, but this is not a mental health benefit.

p. 287
Question 55

Which benefit do individuals with obesity receive from regular exercise in conjunction with

reduced caloric intake? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| Increased weight loss
rv] | Improved quality of life
rv] | Improved blood pressure
rv] m| Improved blood lipid levels
rv] | Improved insulin sensitivity

I °

That's right!

Rationale

Regular exercise, in conjunction with reduced caloric intake, can support body weight loss in individuals with
obesity. Exercise can promote improved physical fitness and quality of life for obese individuals. Health
benefits from exercise for obese individuals include improved blood pressure, blood lipid levels, and insulin

sensitivity.

p. 285
Question 56

In which way do resistance training programs improve blood lipid profiles? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| Triglyceride levels are decreased.

rv] | Total cholesterol levels are decreased.

rv] m| Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are decreased.

x) | High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are increased.

rv] | Ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is decreased.
So close!

Rationale

Resistance training programs can improve blood lipid profiles by significantly lowering total triglyceride levels,
total cholesterol levels, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-
density lipoprotein. Aerobic exercise, not resistance training, has been shown to increase high-density

lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

p. 284
Question 57

Which guideline for physical activity is specific to older adults? Select all that apply.One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

| Level of effort for physical activity should coincide with level of fitness.

150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week is recommended.

a
m| Chronic conditions should be considered when determining which regular activity is safe.
a

Muscle-strengthening activities involving all major muscle groups are recommended at least 2 days

per week.

| Weekly physical activity that includes balance training, aerobic, and muscle-strengthening activities is
recommended.

That's right!

Rationale

Older adults should determine their level of effort for physical activity relative to their level of fitness. Older
adults should try to perform 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Older adults with
chronic conditions should understand whether and how their conditions affect their ability to perform regular
physical activity safely. As part of their weekly physical activity, older adults should focus on physical activity
that includes balance training and aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Muscle-strengthening
activities involving all major muscle groups are recommended at least 2 days per week for older adults.

p. 283
Question 58

Which exercise is an example of an aerobic activity? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

rv) mw] 45 minutes on the treadmill

mw] 30 minutes on the stair climber

60 minutes of gymnastics

180 minutes of golfing

oO
rv) m| 45 minutes of jogging
oO

m| 30 minutes of swimming

That's right!

Rationale

Aerobic activities increase heart rate and are classified as moderate or vigorous. Aerobic activities should be
done for at least 20 minutes for a total of 150 minutes per week. Examples of aerobic activity include 45
minutes on the treadmill, 30 minutes on the stair climber, 45 minutes of jogging, and 30 minutes of
swimming. Gymnastics is considered a flexibility activity, which focuses on stretching. Golfing is considered a
lifestyle activity, which is of moderate intensity.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 287
Question 59

Which guideline would be followed for exercise preparation and care? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Rest when tired.

Stop when hurting.

|
m| Warm up the muscles.
|

Do not go beyond tolerance limits.

Increase the exercise level rapidly.

That's right!

Rationale

It is important to listen to the body when beginning an exercise program and rest when tired to prevent
injury. If the body starts hurting, it is time to stop exercise and rest to prevent injury. Taking the time to warm
up the muscles before exercise will help to prevent stress or injury. To avoid injury, do not go beyond tolerance

limits. The level of exercise should be increased gradually, not rapidly, when the patient is ready for a greater
challenge.

p. 288
Question 60

Which factor needs to be assessed when planning a personal exercise program? Select all

that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Fitness level

Dietary needs

| Health status

Personal needs

Equipment needs

So close!

Rationale

When planning a personal exercise program, it is important to assess the fitness level of the individual to
prevent injury when first beginning to exercise. Health status is important when planning an exercise
program in order to determine which type of exercise the individual is capable of participating in. Personal
needs of the individual should be considered so that benefits can be achieved in the areas of concern.
Resources necessary for equipment and the related costs are important to consider so the individual can plan
for any expenses. Dietary needs are important to consider once the individual has begun an exercise program
so that proper nutrition for the amount of energy expended can be determined; this cannot be assessed
before the personal exercise program has begun.

Question 61

Which food is a good choice to include in a pregame meal? Select all that apply.One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

m| Rice

Pasta

Bread

Granola

Whole milk

Peanut butter

So close!

Rationale

Rice, pasta, bread, and granola are appropriate food choices for a pregame meal because of their high
carbohydrate content. Nonfat milk is preferred over whole milk for the pregame meal to keep the fat content
low. Peanut butter is high in fat, which should be avoided.

Question 63

Which benefit is associated with resistance training? Select all that apply.One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

rv] m| Improves blood pressure
rv] m| Increases insulin sensitivity
rv] m™| Creates and maintains bone strength
rv] m™| Creates and maintains muscle strength
rv] | Decreases the risk for falls
I °

That's right!

Rationale

Resistance training improves blood pressure in prehypertensive and hypertensive individuals and increases
insulin sensitivity. It also creates and maintains muscle and bone strength. Both aerobic and resistance-type
exercise can decrease the risk for falls. In these exercises, muscles are working against gravity and can help

with balance.

p. 287
Question 64

For people who cannot lift heavy weights or participate in high-intensity aerobic activity,
which activity is recommended? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Cy) | Walking
Cy) | Water aerobics

Cy) | Low-impact workouts

Muscle strengthening

Active sports

That's right!

Rationale

Walking, water aerobics, and other low-impact workouts are recommended for people who cannot lift heavy
weights or participate in high-intensity aerobic activity. Muscle strengthening is not recommended because it
may cause injury. Active sports may be considered a high-intensity activity and should be avoided by people
who cannot participate in high-intensity aerobic activity.

p. 283
Question 65

Which factor would be considered when determining a general training diet for individuals

who regularly participate in physical activity? Select all that apply.One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Nutrient and energy needs are determined by age group.

A well-balanced diet can prevent exercise-induced malnutrition.

Regardless of diet, athletes are at risk for injury and infection.

A well-balanced diet should contain adequate calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients.

Failure to meet the increased energy and fluid needs can have significant consequences.

So close!

Rationale

Nutrient and energy needs are determined by age group; recommendations for adults may not apply to child

and adolescent athletes. A well-balanced diet can prevent exercise-induced malnutrition and should contain

adequate calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients. Failure to meet the increased energy and fluid needs

can have significant consequences, because heavy training renders individuals more susceptible to injury and

infection.

A pregame meal should include low amounts of fat and fiber. A sufficient amount of fluid in the pregame
meal helps with digestion and absorption. Moderate amounts of protein can be included in the pregame
meal. The pregame meal should provide a sufficient amount of carbohydrate (approximately 1 to 4 g of
carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight). Protein slows the rate of emptying in the stomach and should only
be included in low to moderate amounts. The pregame meal should be consumed 2 to 4 hours before the

event, not 24 hours before the event.

Question 67

Which pathology may become evident at the clinical end of the spectrum of the female

athlete triad? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) mw] Amenorrhea

rv) | Osteoporosis

Eating disorders

rv) m| Low energy availability

Health problems, such as cardiac arrhythmias

That's right!

Rationale

Amenorrhea is one of the pathologies identified at the clinical end of the spectrum of the female athlete triad.
Loss of bone mineral density can lead to osteoporosis, which becomes evident at the clinical end of the
spectrum of the female athlete triad. Low energy availability, with or without disordered eating, is evident at
the clinical end of the spectrum of the female athlete triad. Eating disorders are sometimes a factor leading to
further problems, but they are not always evident. Serious health problems, such as cardiac arrhythmias, may
occur if an eating disorder is present, but they are not always evident at the clinical end of the spectrum of the

female athlete triad.

Question 68

In which way can an athlete following a vegetarian diet expect to meet their increased

nutrient needs? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Obtain specific nutrition education.

| Use an intentional, thought-out meal plan.

Supplement with iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, and vitamin D.

rv) m| Consume plant-based protein sources throughout the day.

| Consult a sports dietitian to determine any nutrient areas of concern.

That's right!

Rationale

An athlete following a vegetarian diet may benefit from specific nutrition education to learn how to properly
meet their nutrient needs. An intentional, thought-out meal plan can help the athlete to meet their increased
nutrient needs. A balanced vegetarian diet that includes a variety of plant-based protein sources consumed
consistently throughout the day can easily meet the protein needs of all active individuals. A sports dietitian
can assess a vegetarian athlete’s diet to identify any deficiencies or specific nutrients of concern. Depending
on the degree of dietary restrictions, supplementation may be considered, but a sports dietitian should assess

the diet for any specific nutrients of concern before beginning supplementation.

Question 69

Which performance supplement shows ergogenic potential but requires further research
before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding its use? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@| Carnitine

Probiotics

a
| Food polyphenols
a

Omega-3 fatty acids

Sodium bicarbonate

That's right!

Rationale

Carnitine is an equivocal performance supplement that plays a critical role in energy production, but
additional research is needed to substantiate potential ergogenic effects. Probiotics show ergogenic potential
but require further research before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding their use. Food
polyphenols like quercetin, curcumin, and anthocyanin show ergogenic potential but require further research
before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding their use. Omega-3 fatty acids show ergogenic
potential but require further research before conclusive recommendations can be made regarding their use.
Sodium bicarbonate is an established performance supplement that helps to reduce fatigue associated with

high-intensity exercise.

p. 296
Question 70

Which established performance supplement provides a better response to untrained
individuals than trained individuals? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may

be correct.

Cy) @| Nitrate
Caffeine

Creatine

Cy) | Beta-alanine

Sodium bicarbonate

That's right!

Rationale

It appears that trained individuals have less of a response to nitrate supplementation compared with
untrained individuals. Beta-alanine may reduce fatigue, particularly in untrained individuals. Caffeine has
established performance benefits that assist trained and untrained individuals. Creatine loading can have
acute performance benefits in both trained and untrained individuals, particularly for athletes in weight-class
sports or endurance sports. Sodium bicarbonate reduces the fatigue associated with high-intensity exercise

and can benefit trained and untrained individuals.

p. 296
Question 71

Which physiologic side effect can occur when anabolic steroids are taken in megadoses?

Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Hypomania

Mood swings

Gynecomastia

Liver abnormalities

Atrophy of testicles

Increased risk for atherosclerosis

That's right!

Rationale

When athletes take anabolic steroids in megadoses, masculinization and gynecomastia can occur. Liver
abnormalities, such as dysfunction, tumor, and hepatitis, can occur when anabolic steroids are taken in
megadoses. Atrophy of the testicles and decreased sperm production are also physiologic side effects of
megadoses of anabolic steroids. Increased risk for atherosclerosis is another physiologic side effect of taking
anabolic steroids in megadoses. Hypomania is a psychologic effect, not a physiologic side effect, of taking
anabolic steroids in megadoses. Mood swings are a psychologic effect that can occur when megadoses of
anabolic steroids are taken.

p. 295
Question 72
a

For high-intensity or endurance exercise lasting more than 1 hour, which recommendation
would be appropriate for nutrition during exercise? Select all that apply.One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

90 g of carbohydrate per hour

15 to 25 g of high-quality protein

| 30 to 60 g of carbohydrate per hour

Equal amounts of food or drink at regular intervals

| Simple carbohydrates with little or no fat, protein, or fiber

That's right!

Rationale

For high-intensity or endurance exercise lasting more than 1 hour, recommendations include consuming 30
to 60 g of carbohydrate per hour, equal amounts of food or drink at regular intervals throughout the exercise,
and simple carbohydrates with little or no fat, protein, or fiber. For high-intensity or endurance exercise
lasting more than 2.5 hours, individuals may need up to 90 g of carbohydrate per hour. Although 15 to 25 g of
high-quality protein will maximize muscle protein synthesis in the recovery stage, it is not recommended
during exercise.

p. 294
Question 73

Which condition may result from the extreme demands placed on the bodies of athletes

involved in heavy training? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be

correct.
| Injury
Infection
Exhaustion

Malnutrition

Dehydration

That's right!

Rationale

Failure to meet the increased energy and fluid needs required for heavy training demands can cause the
athlete to be susceptible to injury. The extreme demands on the body render athletes more susceptible to
immunosuppression and infection. Fatigue and exhaustion can occur if adequate energy is not provided
during prolonged exercise. Exercise-induced malnutrition can occur if adequate calories, macronutrients, and
micronutrients are not provided. Excessive sweating during heavy training can lead to dehydration if fluid-
retention strategies are not implemented during exercise.

p. 290
Question 74

Which factor is important for achieving aerobic benefits? Select all that apply.One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

Always use a personal trainer.

rv) m| Exercise for 150 minutes per week.

rv) m| Exercise at 70% of the maximal heart rate.

rv) m| Check the pulse before, during, and after exercise.

Use a heart monitor to keep track of the heart rate.

That's right!

Rationale

Achieving aerobic benefits requires a total of 150 minutes of exercise per week. Achieving aerobic benefits
requires exercise to be performed at 70% of the maximal heart rate. The pulse should be checked before,
during, and after exercise to monitor progress toward the target heart rate and aerobic capacity. Although
seeking advice and guidance from a certified personal trainer is helpful, it is not necessary to always use a
personal trainer. Heart rate monitors are a convenient way to keep track of the heart rate, but their use is not

necessary.

p. 288
Question 75

Which mental health benefit can be obtained by exercise? Select all that apply.One, some,
or all responses may be correct.
rv) ml Pain is decreased.

| Mood is improved.

Bone density is increased.

iv)

| Sleep quality is improved.
rv) p quality is imp
iv)

m| Stress management is improved.

Cardiovascular disease risk is lowered.

That's right!

Rationale

Exercise stimulates the production of endorphins that decrease pain and improve mood. As individuals age,

stress. Weight-bearing exercise increases bone density, but this affects the skeletal system, not mental health.

Exercise lowers the risk for cardiovascular disease, but this is not a mental health benefit.

p. 287
Question 76

In which way do resistance training programs improve blood lipid profiles? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Triglyceride levels are decreased.

| Total cholesterol levels are decreased.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are increased.

rv) m| Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are decreased.

| Ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is decreased.

That's right!

Rationale

Resistance training programs can improve blood lipid profiles by significantly lowering total triglyceride levels,
total cholesterol levels, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-
density lipoprotein. Aerobic exercise, not resistance training, has been shown to increase high-density

lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

p. 284
Question 77

Which factor needs to be assessed when planning a personal exercise program? Select all

that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Fitness level

Dietary needs

| Health status

| Personal needs

m| Equipment needs

That's right!

Rationale

When planning a personal exercise program, it is important to assess the fitness level of the individual to
prevent injury when first beginning to exercise. Health status is important when planning an exercise
program in order to determine which type of exercise the individual is capable of participating in. Personal
needs of the individual should be considered so that benefits can be achieved in the areas of concern.
Resources necessary for equipment and the related costs are important to consider so the individual can plan
for any expenses. Dietary needs are important to consider once the individual has begun an exercise program
so that proper nutrition for the amount of energy expended can be determined; this cannot be assessed
before the personal exercise program has begun.

p. 288
Question 78

Which food is a good choice to include in a pregame meal? Select all that apply.One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

m| Rice

Pasta

|
m| Bread
|

Granola

Whole milk

Peanut butter

That's right!

Rationale

Rice, pasta, bread, and granola are appropriate food choices for a pregame meal because of their high
carbohydrate content. Nonfat milk is preferred over whole milk for the pregame meal to keep the fat content
low. Peanut butter is high in fat, which should be avoided.

p. 294
Question 79

The nurse is encouraging a 40-year-old patient who weighs 260 Ib to begin an aerobic

exercise program. Calculate the target heart rate for this patient to achieve aerobic benefits.

Record answer in a whole number. @) 126 beats/min

That's right!

Rationale
A 40-year-old patient who weighs 260 Ib should have a target heart rate of 126 beats/min. To calculate the

target heart rate to achieve aerobic benefits of exercise, the nurse would subtract the patient’s age from the
maximum heart rate: 220 - 40 = 180. Next, the nurse would multiply the difference by 70% to determine the
target heart rate: 180 x 0.7 = 126. (It is not necessary to know the patient’s weight to calculate target heart
rate.)

pp. 288-289
Question 80

Which recommendation is included in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Children aged 3 to 5 years should be physically active throughout the day.

Engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity
aerobic activity in adults can be harmful.

@ |B] Children and adolescents age 6 to 17 years should engage in 60 minutes or more of physical activity
each day.

@ |B] Older adults should determine their level of effort of physical activity relative to their level of fitness.

As part of weekly physical activity, older adults should focus their physical activity on bone
strengthening.

That's right!

Rationale

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that children age 3 to 5 years should be physically
active throughout the day. It is also recommended that children and adolescents age 6 to 17 years should
engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day. Older adults should determine their level of effort
of physical activity relative to their level of fitness. Engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300
minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity in adults provides additional and more-extensive
health benefits and is not harmful. It is recommended that older adults focus on physical activity that includes

balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, but not bone strengthening.

pp. 282-283
Question 81

Which hour-long activity will result in the most energy expended?
©) Circuit training, moderate effort
© Mountain bicycling

@ @ Swimming at a vigorous level
© High-impact aerobics

That's right!

Rationale

Swimming at a vigorous level will result in the most energy expended with 686 kcal per hour. Moderate circuit
training will expend 300 kcal per hour. Mountain bicycling will expend 595 kcal per hour. High-impact
aerobics will expend 420 kcal per hour.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the

material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

Question 1

Which method of collecting information about dietary intake involves a lengthy interview

process by a trained nutrition professional?

rv) © Diet history

O 24-hour food recall
O Multiple-day food record

O Food-frequency questionnaires

That's right!

Rationale

The diet history is a lengthy interview process conducted by a highly trained nutrition professional. The 24-
hour food recall is a fast and inexpensive interview requiring the patient to recall their typical dietary intake
over 24 hours. A multiple-day food record requires the patient to record types and amounts of foods and
beverages consumed over 3 to 7 days. A food-frequency questionnaire, self-administered by the patient,
indicates how many times per day, week, month, or year specific foods are consumed.

pp. 303-304
Question 2

Laboratory results for blood urea nitrogen and serum electrolytes are evaluated to

determine which aspect of a patient’s nutrition status?

O Anemia

O Liver function

O Immune function

rv) © Renal function

That's right!

Rationale

Blood urea nitrogen and serum electrolytes tests evaluate a patient’s renal function. Complete blood count is
measured to screen for anemia. Liver enzyme tests evaluate a patient’s liver function. Total lymphocyte count
evaluates a patient’s immune function.

p. 306
Question 3

Which category of drug interactions is the least well-defined?
@ ©@ Herb-drug interactions

©) Food-drug interactions
O Nutrient-drug interactions

© Enteral feeding-drug interactions

That's right!

Rationale

Of these types of interactions, herb-drug interactions are the least well-defined and understood. Greater
research evidence exists to define food-drug and nutrient-drug interactions. No medications are currently
formulated for use with enteral feedings. Research has been done to define the interaction of enteral feedings

and drugs.

p. 313
Question 4

Which should be avoided when taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) to decrease

intake of tyramine? Select all that apply. One, some or all responses may be correct.

m| Cheese

Alcohol

|
mw] Chocolate
|

Grapefruit

Green leafy vegetables

So close!

Rationale

MAOIs can increase the vascular effects of simple vasoactive amines, including tyramine and dopamine.
Cheese, alcohol, and chocolate contain tyramine and should be avoided when taking MAOIs. Grapefruit can
interfere with many drugs but has a low level of tyramine and thus does not have to be avoided with MAOIs.

Green leafy vegetables are rich in vitamin K and are thus contraindicated with anticlotting drugs, but they are
not high in tyramine and do not need to be avoided with MAOIs.

p. 312
Question 5

Which are the three components of nutritional monitoring and evaluation?
© Problem, etiology, signs/symptoms
O Interview, observation, medical record review

Cy) © Monitor progress, measure outcomes, evaluate outcomes

© Gather data, cluster data, group information

That's right!

Rationale

The three components of nutritional monitoring and evaluation are monitoring progress, measuring
outcomes, and evaluating outcomes. Identifying problem, etiology, and signs/symptoms is the process of
writing the diagnostic statement. Interview, observation, and medical record review are techniques to gather
data during the assessment phase of the nutrition care process. Gathering data, clustering data, and grouping

information are techniques used to identify the nutrition diagnosis.

p. 310
Question 6

The registered dietitian (RD) is reviewing the chart of a patient admitted with a stroke 5
days ago. Which is the priority nutritional diagnosis for the patient?
O Self-feeding difficulty related to stroke, as evidenced by right-sided weakness

O Unreadiness for diet and lifestyle alterations related to stroke, as evidenced by the patient stating, "I
do not want to eat or drink if | cannot do it myself.”

@ ©@ Swallowing difficulty related to stroke, as evidenced by coughing following drinking of thin liquids

© Inability to manage self-care related to stroke, as evidenced by right-sided weakness

That's right!

Rationale

The priority nutrition diagnosis in this situation is "Swallowing difficulty related to stroke, as evidenced by
coughing following drinking of thin liquids." This indicates that the airway could be compromised because the
patient has signs of aspiration. The patient should have nothing by mouth, the health care provider should be
notified, and further testing should be done, because aspiration may compromise respirations. Self-feeding
difficulty is a problem for the patient but it is not the priority. Respiratory status is the priority. Depression
often occurs in the recovery phase of stroke, as indicated by the patient’s statement; however, physical needs
such as aspiration prevention precede psychosocial needs such as depression. The inability to manage self-

care is not the priority when respiratory status is compromised.

p. 308
Question 7

The registered dietitian (RD) is formulating a nutrition care plan for a patient at risk for
developing hypertension. Which nutrition diagnosis is most appropriate?

rv) © Excessive calorie intake related to regular consumption of large portions of high-fat meals, as
evidenced by diet history and body mass index (BMI) of 35

© Altered gastrointestinal function related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), as evidenced by
complaints of heartburn and test results

© Undesirable food choices related to history of anorexia nervosa, as evidenced by 24-hour dietary recall
and weight loss of 5 Ib

© Increased energy needs related to multiple traumas, as evidenced by results of indirect calorimetry

That's right!

Rationale

The diagnosis most appropriate for a patient at risk for hypertension is "Excessive calorie intake related to
regular consumption of large portions of high-fat meals, as evidenced by diet history and BMI of 35."As the
RD performs the nutritional assessment and clusters the data, risk factors for hypertension include obesity,
high-fat meals, and BMI of 35. Altered gastrointestinal function related to GERD does not indicate a risk for
hypertension. Undesirable food choices caused by anorexia would result in problems such as dental caries,
cardiac dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and thin body stature, not the development of hypertension.

Increasing sources of energy (i.e., food) for a patient at risk for hypertension is contraindicated.

p. 308
Question &

Which should not be consumed at high levels when taking phenytoin?
© Yogurt

@ © Oranges

© @ Chocolates

© Bottled apple juice

So close!

Rationale

Large doses of foods that contain high levels of folate or pyridoxine can reduce blood levels of anticonvulsants
including phenytoin. Citrus fruits like oranges contain high levels of folate and could be impacting the
phenytoin blood levels due to a recent increased intake. Yogurt, chocolates, and bottled apple juice do not
contain high levels of folate or pyridoxine.

p. 312
Question 9

Which commonly used drug results in low-level chronic loss of iron when used

continuously?
rv) O Aspirin
O Docusate
O Simethicone

x) © Omeprazole

So close!

Rationale

Aspirin is an irritant to the stomach and intestine; continuous use leads to low-level chronic loss of iron
secondary to mucosal erosion. Docusate is a laxative and does not cause low-level chronic loss of iron.
Simethicone is an antiflatulent and does not cause low-level chronic loss of iron. Omeprazole is a proton

pump inhibitor and does not cause chronic low-level loss of iron.

pp. 313-314
Question 10

A patient presents with nausea, jaundice, dark-colored urine, and low INH levels. Which
assessment question would be important to ask a patient to help determine the reason for
these symptoms?

@ @ "How much alcohol do you drink?"

© "Have you recently traveled abroad?"
©) "Have you been drinking a lot of coffee lately?"

© "Have you been taking your medication as prescribed?"

That's right!

Rationale

Alcohol intake with isoniazid can increase the possibility of hepatotoxicity and decrease the blood level of
isoniazid, so asking the patient about alcohol intake would be important. The patient’s symptoms are unlikely
to be caused by any disease contracted abroad. Coffee typically does not cause these symptoms, and a lack of

INH itself would not cause nausea, jaundice, or dark-colored urine.

pp. 310-311
Question 11

Which of the following statements regarding the nutrient needs caused by drug side effects
is incorrect?

rv) O "They are taking triamterene, so | will need to ensure that they have extra potassium in their diets."

O "Vitamin B 12 supplementation may be needed for my patient who is using famotidine to address
heartburn."

© ©@ "The patient who is taking phenytoin to control seizures may need to increase intake of folate and
vitamins D and K."

© "My patient who is using an oral contraceptive containing estrogen and progestin needs to increase
intake of folate and vitamin B ¢."

So close!

Rationale

Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, so these patients will not need to have increased potassium in
the diet, making this an incorrect statement. Famotidine decreases absorption of vitamin B 17, so supplements
may be needed. Phenytoin increases the metabolism of folate, vitamin D, and vitamin K, so intake of these
nutrients would need to be increased. Oral contraceptives that contain estrogen and progestin can cause
selective malabsorption, or increased metabolism and turnover, which can affect vitamin B ¢ and folate,
requiring an increase in intake of these nutrients.

Test-Taking Tip: Answer the question that is asked. Read the situation and the question carefully, looking for
key words or phrases. Do not read anything into the question or apply what you did in a similar situation

during one of your clinical experiences. Think of each question as being an ideal, yet realistic, situation.

p. 312
Question 12

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the use of peppermint regularly?

© "Peppermint is a great herb to use for gastrointestinal issues, and it would be helpful to continue
using it."

@ ©@ ‘Overuse of peppermint can cause heartburn, and the primary health care provider may recommend
you stop using it."

O "Peppermint decreases muscle spasms of the gastrointestinal tract, so it seems odd that you would be
having heartburn."

© "You might try combining the peppermint with an over-the-counter antacid or proton pump inhibitor
to address the heartburn."

That's right!

Rationale

Overuse of peppermint can lead to heartburn, so the nurse’s best response is to tell the patient that the
primary health care provider may recommend they stop using it. The nurse should not recommend continued
use because the peppermint may be causing the heartburn. Peppermint does decrease muscle spasms of the
gastrointestinal tract but stating that it is odd that the patient is experiencing heartburn would not be valid
because peppermint use can be associated with heartburn. The nurse should not recommend continued use
of the peppermint in combination with other medications because the peppermint could be the cause of the

current issues with heartburn.

p. 302
Question 13

Which category of the nutrition assessment can help to identify the use of complementary

and alternative medicine?

rv) O Patient history

O Nutrition-focused physical findings

O Anthropometric measurements

x) © Food and nutrition-related history

So close!

Rationale

Guided questioning during the patient history stage of nutrition assessment can help the patient remember
and identify the use of complementary and alternative medicine. Clinical signs relevant to a patient’s nutrition
status are identified during nutrition-focused physical findings. Anthropometric measurements are used in
clinical practice to predict basic nutrition risk parameters and are not used to identify the use of
complementary and alternative medicine. The patient’s basic eating habits are used to identify possible
nutrition deficiencies when the food and nutrition-related history is obtained, but this does not include
identifying the use of complementary and alternative medicine.

p. 308
Question 14

Which step of the nutrition care process evaluates food intake and nutrition-related history,
anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, medical tests and procedures, and

nutrition-focused physical findings but does not include the patient history?

tx} © Assessment
O Diagnosis
O Intervention

@ © Monitoring and evaluation

So close!

Rationale

Nutrition monitoring and evaluation phase identifies the patients’ progress toward their goals and uses all of
the categories used in nutrition assessment except patient history. The nutrition assessment phase uses five
categories to collect, classify, and synthesize information about the patient’s nutrition status, including
nutrition-related history, anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, medical tests and procedures,
nutrition-focused physical findings, and patient history. The nutrition diagnosis phase uses the elements of
problem, etiology, and signs/symptoms to determine the patient’s diagnosis. The nutrition intervention is the
plan developed to resolve the nutrition-related etiology and/or diagnosis after the assessment and diagnosis
have been completed.

p. 302
Question 15

Which supplement should a pregnant patient take with antacids to reduce the risk for

neural tube defects and congenital anomalies in the fetus?

That's right!

Rationale

Antacids can impair folate absorption, and folate deficiencies can cause neural tube defects and congenital
anomalies of the heart, palate, and urinary tract. The effects may be offset by folate supplementation, so the
nurse should instruct the patient to take folate supplements. Antacids may affect other vitamins and minerals

as well, but iron, calcium, and magnesium are not linked to the risk for neural tube defects and congenital
anomalies.

p. 312
Question 16

Which statement about energy expenditure is correct?

© ©@ "Physical activity logs are the best way to determine energy expenditure."
© "Physical activity questionnaires are accurate measures of energy expenditure."
© "Dietary intake logs are accurate measures of energy expenditure."

@ © "The doubly labeled water method is the most accurate measure of energy expenditure."

So close!

Rationale

The gold standard for measuring energy expenditure is the doubly labeled water method. Participants ingest
water labeled with a known concentration of isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. Elimination of the isotopes is
measured to predict the energy expenditure and metabolic rate. Physical activity logs, physical activity
questionnaires, and dietary intake logs are less accurate measures of energy expenditure.

p. 309
Question 17

Which of the following should be closely monitored for patients on anticlotting drugs such

as warfarin or clopidogrel?

rv) © Vitamin K

O Vitamin C
O Vitamin D
O Vitamin A

That's right!

Rationale

Anticlotting drugs inhibit the action of vitamin K. Too much vitamin K in the diet with anticlotting drugs will
oppose the action of the drug while too little could cause serious hemorrhaging. Therefore the nurse needs to
closely monitor the dietary intake of vitamin K for patients receiving anticlotting drugs. Vitamins C, D, and A

do not interact with anticlotting drugs.

Test-Taking Tip: Have confidence in your initial response to an item because it more than likely is the correct

answer.

pp. 311-312
Question 18

Which of the following herbs can have a negative interaction with propranolol?

Cy) O Garlic

So close!

Rationale

Garlic should not be consumed with propranolol because of its potential to inhibit liver metabolism, which
can impact the effects of the propranolol. Ginseng is a hypoglycemic and should not alter the effects of
propranolol. Psyllium is used for its laxative effect and can interfere with the absorption of some drugs but is
not contraindicated with propranolol. Echinacea is used to prevent colds and flus and may lead to

immunosuppression when taken for long periods, but it is does interact with propranolol.

p. 313
Question 19

Which herb has a hypoglycemic effect?

Cy) O Ginseng
tx} © Licorice

O Chamomile
O Alfalfa seed

So close!

Rationale

Ginseng is often used for its hypoglycemic effect. Licorice is used for treatment of peptic ulcer or as an
expectorant and would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for this use. Chamomile is recommended
for indigestion, reduction of tension, and inducement of sleep, among other uses and would not be an
appropriate herb to recommend for a hypoglycemic effect. Alfalfa seed is used to reduce cholesterol levels and

would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for a hypoglycemic effect.

p. 313
Question 20

While completing a patient assessment concerning the use of complementary alternative
therapies, which question posed by the nurse may result in a lack of honest reporting of
supplement use?

@ © "What is the herb you are taking supposed to do?"
© ©@ "Do you use any dietary supplements, including herbs?"
© "Have you experienced any side effects from herb use?

© "Are you seeing an herbalist or naturopathic practitioner?"

So close!

Rationale

Asking the patient what an herb they are taking is "supposed to do" implies skepticism, which may embarrass
the patient and result in dishonest reporting of supplement use. Asking the patient about dietary supplement
use, whether or not the patient has experienced side effects, and whether or not they are seeing an herbalist or
a naturopathic practitioner are therapeutic questions that do not imply skepticism or make the patient feel

defensive.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real

intent of the question.

p. 302
Question 21

Patients taking calcium acetate can suffer from constipation. What dietary modification may
help prevent this drug side effect?
O Avoid consuming alcohol.

O Eat foods low in sodium.
O Add foods that increase dietary protein.
rv) © Drink additional water if urinary output is inadequate.

That's right!

Rationale

Calcium acetate is a phosphate binder that can cause constipation; encouraging the patient to drink additional
fluids if urine output is inadequate can help prevent constipation. Avoiding the use of alcohol will not help
prevent the occurrence of constipation. Eating foods low in sodium or that increase dietary protein will also

not help prevent constipation.

p. 310
Question 22

The consistent daily intake of which nutrient is important when taking an anticoagulant?

Cy) O Vitamin K
O Folic acid
tx} © Potassium

O All fat-soluble vitamins

So close!

Rationale
Anticoagulant drugs interact with vitamin K, which has clotting properties, so consistent dietary intake of

vitamin K is important. Anticoagulant drugs do not interfere with folic acid, potassium, or fat-soluble
vitamins, so consistent daily intake of these nutrients is not necessarily needed.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very
cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and an absolute may be a
reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken
to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices.

Question 23

Which should be avoided when taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) to decrease

intake of tyramine? Select all that apply. One, some or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Cheese

rv) mw) Alcohol
rv) mw] Chocolate

Grapefruit

Green leafy vegetables

That's right!

Rationale

MAOIs can increase the vascular effects of simple vasoactive amines, including tyramine and dopamine.
Cheese, alcohol, and chocolate contain tyramine and should be avoided when taking MAOIs. Grapefruit can
interfere with many drugs but has a low level of tyramine and thus does not have to be avoided with MAOIs.

Green leafy vegetables are rich in vitamin K and are thus contraindicated with anticlotting drugs, but they are
not high in tyramine and do not need to be avoided with MAOIs.

p. 312
Question 24

Which should not be consumed at high levels when taking phenytoin?
O Yogurt
Cy) © Oranges

© Chocolates
© Bottled apple juice

That's right!

Rationale

Large doses of foods that contain high levels of folate or pyridoxine can reduce blood levels of anticonvulsants
including phenytoin. Citrus fruits like oranges contain high levels of folate and could be impacting the
phenytoin blood levels due to a recent increased intake. Yogurt, chocolates, and bottled apple juice do not
contain high levels of folate or pyridoxine.

p. 312
Question 25

Which commonly used drug results in low-level chronic loss of iron when used

continuously?
rv) © Aspirin
O Docusate
O Simethicone

O Omeprazole

That's right!

Rationale

Aspirin is an irritant to the stomach and intestine; continuous use leads to low-level chronic loss of iron
secondary to mucosal erosion. Docusate is a laxative and does not cause low-level chronic loss of iron.
Simethicone is an antiflatulent and does not cause low-level chronic loss of iron. Omeprazole is a proton
pump inhibitor and does not cause chronic low-level loss of iron.

pp. 313-314
Question 26

Which mode of feeding makes use of the gastrointestinal tract through oral or tube
feeding?
O Parenteral feedings

rv) © Enteral feedings

O Intermittent feedings

O Intravenous feedings

That's right!

Rationale
Enteral feedings make use of the gastrointestinal tract through oral or tube feeding. Parenteral feedings

describe fluids, electrolytes, and lipids infused via an intravenous catheter. Intermittent feedings describe the

frequency of feedings. Intravenous feedings are synonymous with parenteral feedings.

Question 27

Which factor may increase the susceptibility of individuals to food-drug interactions? Select

all that apply. One, some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Drug route

lm) Polypharmacy

Literacy level

Language barriers

Medication classification

So close!

Rationale

Multiple medications ( polypharmacy) can increase the potential for errors, thus increasing susceptibility to
interactions. Literacy level and language barriers may impact the ability of individuals to read and understand
drug directions regarding how to take medications or supplements. Route and medication classification do
not affect individual susceptibility to food-drug interactions.

Test-Taking Tip: If you can eliminate any responses as incorrect based on your knowledge, you will not be
guessing randomly but will be exercising "informed guessing."

p. 310
Question 28

Which herb, when combined with bismuth-containing medications, can act as an

anticoagulant? Select all that apply. One, some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Garlic

™| Ginger

| Gingko

™| Ginseng

Valerian

Echinacea

So close!

Rationale

When bismuth-containing medications such as Pepto-Bismol are combined with garlic, ginger, gingko, or
ginseng, they may act as anticoagulants. Studies suggest that valerian is generally safe for use because there
are currently no documented herb-drug interactions with bismuth-containing medications. Echinacea has a
low risk for interaction with other drugs or medications and has not been implicated as enhancing the

anticoagulant effect of bismuth-containing medications.

p. 3131
Question 29

Which of the following herbs can have negative interactions with warfarin?

So close!

Rationale

Ginseng may cause bleeding and enhances the effects warfarin, which can be dangerous because warfarin is
an anticoagulant. Kava may enhance the sedative effects of anesthesia but is not implicated as interacting with
warfarin. Use of ephedra may cause cardiovascular problems, including increased heart rate or arrhythmias
but is not reported as an issue with warfarin. Valerian may interfere with the effects of anesthesia but is not

reported to increase bleeding or interact with warfarin.

p. 313
Question 30

Which pathophysiologic process results in increased absorption of griseofulvin with a high-
fat diet?

rv) © High-fat diets stimulate the secretion of bile acids, hence increasing drug absorption.
O The relative quantities of dietary carbohydrates and fat influence liver enzymes that metabolize drugs.

O The fats in the diet induce mixed-function oxidase enzyme systems in the liver and speed up drug
metabolism.

©) Fat increases the concentration of the unbound active drug by displacing it from binding sites in
plasma and tissue protein.

That's right!

Rationale

Griseofulvin is fat-soluble, and high-fat diets stimulate the secretion of bile acids; this aids in drug absorption.
The relative quantities of carbohydrates and fat can also influence drug distribution and metabolism but are
not the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism behind the increased absorption of griseofulvin. Indoles in
cruciferous vegetables can speed up the rate of drug metabolism by inducing mixed-function oxidase enzyme
systems in the liver that speed up drug metabolism but are not the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism
behind the increased absorption of griseofulvin. Fat increases the concentration of valium, not griseofulvin, by
displacing it from binding sites in plasma and tissue protein.

pp. 310-311
Question 31

Which of the following statements regarding use of ginseng and valerian while on

alprazolam is correct?

O "You should be able to resume taking both of those herbs; they do not interfere with alprazolam."

O "The ginseng will interact with the alprazolam and cause increased sedation, so you shouldn't take
that herb."

© ©@ "You really shouldn't use any herbs because they often interfere with drugs and will result in
rehospitalization."

@ © "You should be able to resume taking the ginseng, but you should not take the valerian because it can
intensify the effect of the alprazolam."

So close!

Rationale

Valerian can intensify effects of sedatives and central nervous system (CNS) depressants, so it should be
avoided when using alprazolam. Ginseng, however, has not been found to interact with CNS depressants and
thus could potentially be resumed. Stating that both could be resumed would not be an appropriate response
by the nurse because valerian can interact with alprazolam. Advising the patient not to take any herbs is not

necessary because not all herbs interact with alprazolam.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will

seem like the correct response.

p. 313
Question 32

When taking naproxen, patients should increase intake of foods high in which nutrient?

Select all that apply. One, some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Iron

@| Zinc

Vitamin C

Folate

m| Vitamin K

So close!

Rationale

Analgesics such as naproxen increase the loss of vitamin C and compete with folate and vitamin K, thus
decreasing these nutrients. Patients should increase their intake of foods high in these nutrients when taking

naproxen routinely. Routine naproxen use does not affect iron and zinc.

p. 312
Question 33

Cimetidine usage increases the risk for which nutrient deficiency? Select all that apply.

One, some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

lron

Thiamin

Niacin

Magnesium

Vitamin B 12

So close!

Rationale

Prolonged use of cimetidine, an H 2 receptor blocker, alters the pH of the stomach resulting in decreased
absorption of iron, thiamine, and vitamin B j2. Decreased absorption of niacin and magnesium are not

associated with prolonged cimetidine use.

pp. 313-314
Question 34

Which is the most likely reason for flushing, headache, increased heart rate and decreased

blood pressure while taking nifedipine?

O Addition of a medication for insomnia approximately 2 weeks ago.
x) © Forgotten dose of nifedipine at bedtime as usual and replaced this morning.
rv) O Meal of two eggs, one slice of bacon, and a glass of grapefruit juice for breakfast.

O Stress for the past several weeks caused by recent diagnosis of cancer for their spouse.

So close!

Rationale

The patient’s report of grapefruit juice for breakfast indicates the most likely reason for the patient’s current
symptoms. Grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability of certain drugs, including nifedipine, thereby
increasing the serum level; this can lead to side effects and/or toxicity. The addition of a new drug for

insomnia is less likely to be the reason for the current symptoms. Taking nifedipine later than normal would
most likely result in increased, not decreased blood pressure. Increased stress may impact vital signs,

resulting in increased blood pressure and so would not be the most likely reason for the current symptoms.

p. 312
Question 35

Which is a possible dietary interaction when taking ciprofloxacin? Select all that apply. One,

some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Calcium

™| Potassium

Magnesium

lron
®) Zinc
So close!
Rationale

Some antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) can bind to calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, thereby
interfering with their absorption. Ciprofloxacin does not interfere with the absorption of potassium.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,
read the situation and essential information carefully, and then formulate your response.

p. 312
Question 36

Which of the following could cause a patient with type 2 diabetes to become confused and
irrational after consuming alcohol while on chlorpropamide?

rv) © The use of alcohol with the chlorpropamide caused hypoglycemia.
O The ingestion of alcohol counteracted the effects of the chlorpropamide.
O The use of alcohol with the chlorpropamide caused alcohol poisoning.

O The alcohol increased the patient’s blood sugar level, causing hyperglycemia.

That's right!

Rationale

Ingestion of alcohol with chlorpropamide lowers the blood glucose level, resulting in symptoms of
hypoglycemia, which include weakness, confusion, and irrational behavior. Alcohol enhances the effects of
chlorpropamide; it does not counter the effects. There is not enough information provided to determine
whether the patient is suffering from alcohol poisoning. The alcohol did not increase the patient’s blood sugar
level; instead, it lowered it.

p. 312
Question 37

Which factor creates the highest risk for drug-nutrient reactions?

© Obesity
©) Soft diet

© Increased appetite

Cy) © Poor nutritional status

That's right!

Rationale

A poor nutritional status can have a major impact on drug-nutrient reactions because abnormal nutrient levels
can alter the effects of drugs. Obesity, a soft diet, and an increased appetite do not carry as high of a risk for
drug-nutrient reactions.

p. 310
Question 38

Which of the following is a dietary need in relation to allopurinol?
@ ©@ The patient should drink 10 to 12 glasses of fluid daily.

© The medication should always be taken with food or milk.
© The patient may need to switch to a soft diet while taking allopurinol.

© The patient’s diet should include high-potassium foods to support potassium levels.

That's right!

Rationale
While taking allopurinol, the patient should drink at least 10 to 12 glasses of fluid daily. Allopurinol is not

required to be taken with food or milk, nor does it require that the patient switch to a soft diet. Allopurinol
does not affect potassium levels, so a high-potassium diet is not indicated.

p. 312
Question 39

The capacity for recovery from illness depends most on which factor?
© Age of the patient

© Family support
© Sense of well-being

Cy) © Nutritional status

That's right!

Rationale

The capacity for recovery from illness depends on a good nutritional status. A poor nutritional status delays
recovery and decreases quality of life. Age of the patient may have implications depending on recovery;
however, optimal nutrition helps decrease metabolic demand and facilitate healing. Family support is a
psychosocial need rather than a physical need. As such, nutritional status has more impact on the patient’s

capacity for recovery. Similarly, a sense of well-being is a psychosocial need, and physical needs take priority.

p. 299
Question 40

Which statement regarding dietary intake while taking Orlistat is correct? Select all that

apply. One, some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| The diet should include no more than 30% of calories from fat.

Orlistat should be taken either with a meal or within 1 hour of eating.

a
| A reduced-calorie diet must be strictly followed for weight loss to occur.
a

Alcohol should be avoided because it may increase the effects of dizziness from this medication.

A multivitamin supplement should be taken at least once a day at least 2 hours before or after the
Orlistat.

So close!

Rationale

Orlistat blocks fat from being absorbed from the intestines, so the diet should include no more than 30% of
calories from fat to avoid an increase in side effects. Additionally, the drug should be taken during or within 1
hour of the meal. A multivitamin should be taken once a day at least 2 hours before or after the Orlistat to
address potential deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins caused by the drug. Following a reduced-calorie diet may
be helpful but is not indicated as a requirement for this particular drug used to treat obesity. Alcohol may
increase the dizziness effects of benzphetamine but is not typically a side effect of Orlistat.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 310
Question 41

Which of the following is the best way to evaluate tolerance of enteral feedings?

© Auscultate the abdomen to verify bowel sounds.
@ © Aspirate gastric residual volume (GRY).

© Obtain and assess the gastric aspirate pH.
© Keep the head of the bed elevated by at least 45 degrees.

That's right!

Rationale

The best way to evaluate tolerance of enteral feedings is to evaluate the gastric residual volume. The nurse
aspirates and measures all stomach contents then returns them into the stomach. If the residual volume is
abnormal, enteral feedings may be altered. Auscultating the abdomen for bowel sounds and assessing gastric
aspirate pH do not indicate tolerance of the feedings. Elevating the head of the bed may be done to prevent
heartburn.

p. 309
Question 42

Which dietary action can help a pregnant patient’s nausea symptoms? Select all that apply.

One, some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | "Drink liquids between, rather than with, meals."

Cy) | “Eat small, frequent meals and snacks that are dry, bland, and low in fiber."

“Eat several servings of dry fruits, vegetables, and whole grains at mealtime."

“Eat whole grains three times per day with each meal."

"Drink at least 500 mL of water with each meal three times per day."

rv) "Try ginger or vitamin B ¢ supplements.”

So close!

Rationale
The nurse may suggest drinking liquids between rather than with meals; consuming small, frequent meals
and snacks that are dry, bland, and low in fiber; and trying ginger or vitamin B ¢ supplements to reduce

nausea. Dry fruits, vegetables, and whole grains at mealtime are suggested to relieve constipation, not nausea.
Eating whole grains three times per day increases gastrointestinal motility and may increase nausea.
Increasing fluids with each meal is appropriate for relief of constipation but this may increase nausea.

p. 309
Question 43

A patient with myasthenia gravis (MG) is complaining of fatigue and weakness. Which is a

concern for this patient at mealtime?
rv) O Dysphagia

O Seizures
x) © Dyskinesia and rigidity

O Unilateral paralysis

So close!

Rationale

MG is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies at the neuromuscular junction that attack
acetylcholine receptors. The attack prevents acetylcholine from stimulating muscle contractions and may
result in dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing. The patient can progress from a weak voice to full respiratory

arrest. Seizures are not common to MG. Dyskinesia and rigidity occur with Parkinson disease, not MG.
Unilateral paralysis occurs with cerebral vascular accidents, not MG.

p. 309
Question 44

A patient arrives in the emergency department with complaints of sharp, intense flank pain.
The patient is diagnosed with renal calculi. Intravenous fluid therapy is initiated, and the
patient is admitted to the medical floor for further management. Which nutritional
intervention is helpful in managing patients with renal calculi? Select all that apply. One,

some or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Restrict animal protein to 1g/kg body weight.

| Restrict calcium to 500 mg per day or less.

Restrict salt intake to less than 2300 mg per day.

Consume no more than three servings per day of fruits or vegetables.

| Increase fluid intake to at least 2 to 3 L per day.

| Limit intake of spinach, beets, nuts, chocolate, tea, and strawberries.

So close!

Rationale

The patient with renal calculi should restrict animal protein to 1g/kg body weight; restrict salt intake to less
than 2300 mg per day; increase fluid intake to 2 to 3 L per day to produce at least 2 L of urine per day; and
limit intake of spinach, rhubarb, beets, nuts, chocolate, tea, wheat bran, and strawberries (which increase
urinary oxalate excretion). Calcium restriction should be avoided. The patient should take 800 to 1500 mg of
calcium per day. Potassium intake should be encouraged. As such, the patient should be advised to consume
five or more servings of fruits and vegetables.

pp. 308-309
Question 45

Which key finding indicates that a patient needs nutrition services? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Increased waist circumference

Serum albumin level of 4.5 g/dL

Decreased appetite

Skin tenting

Unintentional weight loss

So close!

Rationale

On admission, key issues indicating that the patient needs nutrition services include decreased appetite and
unintentional weight loss. Increased waist circumference may indicate obesity; however, diseases such as
cirrhosis may also result in increased weight circumference necessitating further physiologic investigation.
Low serum albumin and prealbumin levels are historically associated with nutritional alterations; however, this
serum albumin level is within the normal range (3.4 to 5 g/dL). Skin tenting may be used to assess hydration

status, but it should be combined with other assessments.

Alcohol should be avoided because it may increase the effects of dizziness from this medication.

rv) m| A multivitamin supplement should be taken at least once a day at least 2 hours before or after the
Orlistat.

That's right!

Rationale

Orlistat blocks fat from being absorbed from the intestines, so the diet should include no more than 30% of
calories from fat to avoid an increase in side effects. Additionally, the drug should be taken during or within 1
hour of the meal. A multivitamin should be taken once a day at least 2 hours before or after the Orlistat to
address potential deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins caused by the drug. Following a reduced-calorie diet may
be helpful but is not indicated as a requirement for this particular drug used to treat obesity. Alcohol may

increase the dizziness effects of benzphetamine but is not typically a side effect of Orlistat.

Question 57

Which of the following statements regarding the nutrient needs caused by drug side effects
is incorrect?

rv) © "They are taking triamterene, so | will need to ensure that they have extra potassium in their diets."

O "Vitamin B 12 supplementation may be needed for my patient who is using famotidine to address
heartburn."

© "The patient who is taking phenytoin to control seizures may need to increase intake of folate and
vitamins D and K."

© "My patient who is using an oral contraceptive containing estrogen and progestin needs to increase
intake of folate and vitamin B ¢."

That's right!

Rationale

Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, so these patients will not need to have increased potassium in
the diet, making this an incorrect statement. Famotidine decreases absorption of vitamin B 17, so supplements
may be needed. Phenytoin increases the metabolism of folate, vitamin D, and vitamin K, so intake of these
nutrients would need to be increased. Oral contraceptives that contain estrogen and progestin can cause
selective malabsorption, or increased metabolism and turnover, which can affect vitamin B ¢ and folate,
requiring an increase in intake of these nutrients.

Test-Taking Tip: Answer the question that is asked. Read the situation and the question carefully, looking for
key words or phrases. Do not read anything into the question or apply what you did in a similar situation

during one of your clinical experiences. Think of each question as being an ideal, yet realistic, situation.

Question 58

Which category of the nutrition assessment can help to identify the use of complementary

and alternative medicine?

rv) © Patient history

O Nutrition-focused physical findings
O Anthropometric measurements

O Food and nutrition-related history

That's right!

Rationale

Guided questioning during the patient history stage of nutrition assessment can help the patient remember
and identify the use of complementary and alternative medicine. Clinical signs relevant to a patient’s nutrition
status are identified during nutrition-focused physical findings. Anthropometric measurements are used in
clinical practice to predict basic nutrition risk parameters and are not used to identify the use of
complementary and alternative medicine. The patient’s basic eating habits are used to identify possible
nutrition deficiencies when the food and nutrition-related history is obtained, but this does not include

identifying the use of complementary and alternative medicine.

Rationale

Nutrition monitoring and evaluation phase identifies the patients’ progress toward their goals and uses all of
the categories used in nutrition assessment except patient history. The nutrition assessment phase uses five
categories to collect, classify, and synthesize information about the patient’s nutrition status, including
nutrition-related history, anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, medical tests and procedures,
nutrition-focused physical findings, and patient history. The nutrition diagnosis phase uses the elements of
problem, etiology, and signs/symptoms to determine the patient’s diagnosis. The nutrition intervention is the
plan developed to resolve the nutrition-related etiology and/or diagnosis after the assessment and diagnosis
have been completed.

Question 60

Which statement about energy expenditure is correct?

© "Physical activity logs are the best way to determine energy expenditure."
© "Physical activity questionnaires are accurate measures of energy expenditure."
© "Dietary intake logs are accurate measures of energy expenditure."

@ ©@ "The doubly labeled water method is the most accurate measure of energy expenditure."

That's right!

Rationale
The gold standard for measuring energy expenditure is the doubly labeled water method. Participants ingest

water labeled with a known concentration of isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. Elimination of the isotopes is
measured to predict the energy expenditure and metabolic rate. Physical activity logs, physical activity
questionnaires, and dietary intake logs are less accurate measures of energy expenditure.

p. 309
Question 61

Which of the following herbs can have a negative interaction with propranolol?

@ @ Garlic
O Ginseng
© Payllium

O Echinacea

That's right!

Rationale

Garlic should not be consumed with propranolol because of its potential to inhibit liver metabolism, which
can impact the effects of the propranolol. Ginseng is a hypoglycemic and should not alter the effects of
propranolol. Psyllium is used for its laxative effect and can interfere with the absorption of some drugs but is
not contraindicated with propranolol. Echinacea is used to prevent colds and flus and may lead to

immunosuppression when taken for long periods, but it is does interact with propranolol.

p. 313
Question 62

Which herb has a hypoglycemic effect?

Cy) © Ginseng
O Licorice

O Chamomile
O Alfalfa seed

That's right!

Rationale

Ginseng is often used for its hypoglycemic effect. Licorice is used for treatment of peptic ulcer or as an
expectorant and would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for this use. Chamomile is recommended
for indigestion, reduction of tension, and inducement of sleep, among other uses and would not be an
appropriate herb to recommend for a hypoglycemic effect. Alfalfa seed is used to reduce cholesterol levels and

would not be an appropriate herb to recommend for a hypoglycemic effect.

p. 313
Question 63

While completing a patient assessment concerning the use of complementary alternative
therapies, which question posed by the nurse may result in a lack of honest reporting of
supplement use?

@ © "What is the herb you are taking supposed to do?"
© ©@ "Do you use any dietary supplements, including herbs?"
© "Have you experienced any side effects from herb use?

© "Are you seeing an herbalist or naturopathic practitioner?"

So close!

Rationale

Asking the patient what an herb they are taking is "supposed to do" implies skepticism, which may embarrass
the patient and result in dishonest reporting of supplement use. Asking the patient about dietary supplement
use, whether or not the patient has experienced side effects, and whether or not they are seeing an herbalist or
a naturopathic practitioner are therapeutic questions that do not imply skepticism or make the patient feel

defensive.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real

intent of the question.

Question 1

Which statement about dietary considerations for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is

accurate?

x) © Patients with CF need to eat foods low in calories and fat.
O Patients with CF should receive a liquid diet to rest the bowel.
rv) O Patients with CF require increased calories and fat intake.

O Patients with CF should not receive snacks.

So close!

Rationale

The focus of nutritional intervention for patients with CF include increased calorie intake, increased fat intake,
and maintenance of lean body mass. Dietary recommended intakes (DRIs) for patients with CF over 2 years of
age may require more nutrients (110% to 200%) depending on the severity of the disease. A liquid diet would
not provide enough nutritional value, and bowel rest is not necessary for cystic fibrosis. Patients with cystic
fibrosis should receive three meals and two to three snacks per day.

p. 328
Question 2

The nurse admits a patient to the medical floor with a diagnosis of cholecystitis and
cholelithiasis. Which diet order does the nurse anticipate will help decrease the patient’s
symptoms?

©) Low-carbohydrate

© low-sodium

Cy) © Low-fat

© High-protein

That's right!

Rationale

Cholecystitis with cholelithiasis is inflammation of the gallbladder with gall stones. As fat enters the intestine,
the hormone cholecystokinin triggers gallbladder contractions to release bile. Cholecystitis with cholelithiasis
causes pain during normal contraction of the gallbladder; therefore a low-fat diet is appropriate. A low-
carbohydrate diet is often prescribed for patients with diabetes mellitus. A low-sodium diet is appropriate for
patients with hypertension or fluid-retaining disorders. A high-protein diet may be necessary for patients with
cystic fibrosis.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 341
Question 3
LS

After eating shellfish, a patient’s airway becomes severely edematous. The patient is
intubated, placed on a mechanical ventilator, and admitted to the intensive care unit for
continued medical management. What is this severe, potentially fatal reaction to ingestion

of an allergen called?

O Allergy

O Adverse reaction

rv) © Anaphylactic shock
O Sentinel event

That's right!

Rationale

A severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction as described is called anaphylacticshock. An allergy is a state of
hypersensitivity to a particular substance in the environment that produces problems in the functioning of
affected tissues. An adverse reaction is usually attributed to unintended effects of medications. A sentinel
event is an unanticipated event in the health care setting that results in severe psychological distress, serious
physical injury, or death.

p. 334
Question 4

Which statement about diet therapy for patients with food allergies is accurate?
@ ©@ Patients with food allergies should avoid offending foods.

© Patients with food allergies should never substitute alternatives for offending foods.
© Mothers should avoid breastfeeding newborns so allergies do not develop.

© Children tend to develop stronger allergies as they grow.

That's right!

Rationale

Patients with allergies should avoid offending foods to decrease risk for adverse reactions. Patients with food
allergies should substitute offending foods with nutritionally appropriate alternatives. Babies exclusively
breastfed have a reduction of food allergies. Children tend to outgrow food allergies.

p. 334
Question 5

Which instructions should the nurse include in the discharge plan of care for the patient
diagnosed with xerostomia?

O Avoid extremes in food temperature.
O Continue eating a mechanical soft diet.
rv) © Maintain regular dental appointments.

O Abstain from additional gravies and sauces on foods.

That's right!

Rationale

In the discharge plan of care for the patient diagnosed with xerostomia, the nurse should instruct the patient
to maintain regular dental appointments. Xerostomia is chronic dry mouth and can cause tooth decay.
Avoiding extremes in food temperature is more applicable to a patient with mouth ulcers. There is no reason a
patient with xerostomia should be on a mechanical soft diet; this may be helpful for a patient with tooth loss
or lacking teeth. Additional gravies and sauces on food may help facilitate the eating process.

p. 319
Question 6

A patient asks the nurse, "What keeps causing these canker sores?" What is the nurse’s best

response?

O "Your sores are a caused by lack of oral hygiene."
x) © "Your canker sores are caused by a herpes simplex virus."
O "That is thrush caused by the fungus Candida albicans."

rv) O "They are caused by bacteria known as hemolytic Streptococcus."

So close!

Rationale

The nurse’s best response to the patient is "They are caused by a bacteria known as hemolytic Streptococcus." A
canker sore is not caused by lack of oral hygiene. Herpes simplex virus does not cause canker sores, but it
does cause mouth sores known as cold sores or fever blisters on the inside mucous lining of the lips and

cheeks or on the external portion of the lips. Thrush is caused by the fungus Candida albicans, which can cause
similar sores on the oral mucosa.

p. 318
Question 7

Which diet is most helpful for a patient who has inadequate dentition?

© Pureed
© Full-liquid
© Regular
@ © Mechanical soft

That's right!

Rationale

A mechanical soft diet will be ordered for a patient who has inadequate dentition. All foods in a mechanical
diet require less chewing than a regular diet, and the foods are soft-cooked and the meats are ground. A
pureed diet requires no chewing and consists of food that is blended and prepared with added liquids to form
a soft, smooth, thick paste, which is not necessary for a patient who has inadequate dentition. A full-liquid diet
is used to transition between a clear and soft diet. A regular diet may be difficult for the patient with
inadequate dentition to chew.

p. 317
Question &

What effect can long-term stress have on the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract?
© Achalasia

O Hiatal hernia

@ ©@ Peptic ulcer disease
© Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

That's right!

Rationale

Peptic ulcer disease is an effect of long-term stress on the GI tract. Negative effects on the Gl tract that occur
as a result of long-term stress include changes in gut motility, gastric secretion, mucosal permeability, and
barrier function. Achalasia is a mechanical disorder of the esophagus in which the muscles of the tube fail to
relax, thereby inhibiting normal swallowing. A hiatal hernia occurs when a portion of the upper stomach
protrudes through the opening in the diaphragm. GERD is a result of the constant regurgitation of acid in the
lower portion of the esophagus, which can result in erosion of the lining.

p. 324
Question 9

Which sign or symptom is a common reaction to food allergens? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

mw) Diarrhea

Nausea

a
m| Vomiting
a

Abdominal distention

Blurry vision

Ringing in the ears

That's right!

Rationale

Common signs and symptoms produced by allergic reactions include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
distention, cramping, and pain. Blurry vision is not a common symptom associated with an allergic reaction.

Ringing in the ears may occur with a reaction to aspirin, not food.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 334
Question 10

A patient with Crohn's disease presents to the emergency department with watery diarrhea.
Which diet would be most helpful to the patient?

O Low-protein, low-calorie

x) © High-carbohydrate, low-protein
O Increased fiber

rv) O High-protein, low-fat, lactose-free

So close!

Rationale

A patient experiencing watery diarrhea caused by Crohn's disease would benefit from increased proteins and
calories, low fats and lactose, and avoidance of foods that stimulate peristalsis. Increased protein will help the
patient’s overall strength and nutritional health. Increasing carbohydrates but reducing protein is not best for

this patient. Increasing fiber is not enough for this patient.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

p. 331
Question 11

Which diet is appropriate for a patient with celiac disease?
© DASH diet

Cy) © Gluten-free diet

© Carbohydrate-counting
© High-fiber diet

That's right!

Rationale

Celiac disease is a digestive disease that damages the small intestine and interferes with absorption of
nutrients from food. A patient with celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten-containing foods because the
immune system responds by damaging or destroying villi lining the small intestine. Therefore a patient with
celiac disease should be prescribed a gluten-free diet. The DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension)
diet is for patients with hypertension. Carbohydrate-counting is an appropriate diet for a diabetic patient. A
high-fiber diet is prescribed for patients with chronic constipation or for those with diverticulosis.

p. 336
Question 12

A toddler develops hives, nausea, and diarrhea after eating a peanut butter and jelly

sandwich, apple slices, and milk for lunch. The toddler’s mother asks the nurse if the child’s

symptoms are caused by a peanut allergy. What is the nurse’s best response?

© "tis probably an allergy to peanuts. It is a common problem in children."
© "lhave no idea what is wrong with your child. It doesn’t sound like an allergy."

@ ©@ "It is difficult to tell. Your child’s pediatrician ordered a skin prick test and some lab work to help
identify your child’s allergens."

© "Iwill ask the pediatrician to come in and talk to you about peanut allergies."

That's right!

Rationale

The best response by the nurse is, "It is difficult to tell. Your child’s pediatrician ordered a skin prick test and
some lab work to help identify your child’s allergens." The nurse is answering the parent with the most
accurate information. Stating that it is probably an allergy to peanuts is not the best way to respond. The child
also ate milk and wheat, which are common allergens. It is inappropriate for the nurse to respond that they
have no idea because the mother is looking to the nurse for information and guidance. In addition, stating "It
doesn’t sound like an allergy" is inaccurate because the signs and symptoms displayed by the toddler are
common with food allergies. Stating that the nurse will ask the pediatrician to speak with the mother about
peanut allergies is inappropriate because the allergen has not been determined.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the

material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 334
Question 13

Which assessment finding is associated with a diagnosis of diverticulitis? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Fever

Vasculitis

@ |B] Bloody diarrhea

Cy) Nausea and vomiting

Pain and tenderness in the lower right abdomen

So close!

Rationale

Fever, bloody diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting are findings associated with diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a
result of the diverticula becoming infected. Vasculitis is an inflammatory complication of cystic fibrosis. Pain

and tenderness occur in the lower left abdomen in the patient with diverticulitis.

p. 332
Question 14

What general dietary principle should be included in the teaching for a patient with cystic
fibrosis?

O Restrict sodium intake.
O Consume low-fat foods.
O Increase intake of water-soluble vitamins.

rv) © Include pancreatic enzyme supplementation.

That's right!

Rationale

Use of pancreatic enzyme supplementation should be included in the teaching for a patient with cystic
fibrosis. Pancreatic enzyme supplementation is necessary for the digestion of foods. Sodium intake does not
have to be restricted. The disease process inhibits the normal movement of sodium ions in the body tissue, so
sodium depletion occurs through an increased salt concentration in body perspiration. The patient’s diet is
unrestricted and should include high-fat foods because of malabsorption syndrome that occurs as a result of
the disease process. Vitamin supplementation is important, but it is unnecessary for increasing the intake of
water-soluble vitamins. Supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins is significantly important because of

pancreatic insufficiency.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will

seem like the correct response.

p. 328
Question 15

Which dietary management principle should be applied during periods of inflammation for
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

x) © Implementing high-fiber meals
rv) O Providing low-fat meals
O Increasing antioxidant intake

O Initiating total parenteral nutrition

So close!

Rationale

The nurse should provide low-fat meals to patients with IBD during periods of inflammation. Foods high in
fat can cause gas and diarrhea during periods of inflammation caused by inadequate absorption of fat. High-
fiber meals should be avoided during periods of inflammation. Increasing antioxidant intake is initiated

during the period of remission. Total parenteral nutrition is initiated only if necessary.

p. 331
Question 16

When providing nutrition to a severely malnourished patient, for which complication

should the nurse monitor the patient?

O Tetany
O Dysphagia
O Cardiospasm

Refeeding syndrome
0 ® B sy

That's right!

Rationale

When providing nutrition to a severely malnourished patient, the nurse should monitor the patient for
refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome is a fatal metabolic disturbance that involves fluid and electrolyte
imbalances and can result in cardiac arrest. Tetany is a result of low levels of calcium that can occur in chronic
nutritional deficiency. Dysphagia is a chronic swallowing disorder; it is not a complication of providing
nutrition to a severely malnourished patient. Cardiospasm is a condition that is medically termed achalasia

and is a disorder in the esophagus.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 332
Question 17

Which of the following is a complication of untreated fatty liver disease?

Cy) © Cirrhosis

O Gastroparesis
© Celiac disease

© Peptic ulcer disease

That's right!

Rationale

Cirrhosis is end-stage liver failure that can result from untreated fatty liver disease. Gastroparesis is paralysis
of the stomach that can be a complication from uncontrolled diabetes. Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune
disorder in the lining of the small intestine. Peptic ulcer disease is a breakdown in the lining of the stomach

or duodenum.

p. 338
Question 18

For what complication should the nurse monitor the patient with liver disease and low

plasma protein levels?

rv) © Ascites
O Obesity
O Fecal occult blood

O Excess hair growth

That's right!

Rationale

Malnutrition and protein deficiencies that cause ascites are common complications in patients with liver
failure. Weight loss is a complication of liver disease. Fecal occult blood is a symptom of gastrointestinal
bleeding. Excess hair growth is a side effect of steroid medications.

p. 340
Question 19

Which food should the patient diagnosed with celiac disease avoid? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Potatoes

rv) mw) Wheat

Rice

rv) m| Barley

Soy

Tapioca

That's right!

Rationale

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the mucosa of the small intestine, especially the
duodenum and proximal jejunum, is damaged by dietary gluten found in foods like wheat and barley. Grains

and plant foods allowed include potatoes, rice, soy, and tapioca.

p. 337
Question 20

Which diet is recommended for a patient with hepatic encephalopathy?
© High-fat

Cy) © Low-protein

©) Daily sodium intake of 3.5 g
©) Low-carbohydrate

That's right!

Rationale

If a patient has hepatic encephalopathy, protein intake will be reduced to keep the ammonia level from rising.
Additional recommendations include a low-fat diet, a daily sodium intake of 2 g, and high carbohydrate
intake.

p. 340
Question 21

Which inflammatory bowel disease can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract?

Cy) © Crohn’s disease

O Diverticulosis
O Ulcerative colitis

© Irritable bowel syndrome

That's right!

Rationale

Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract from

the esophagus to the anus. Ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis, and irritable bowel syndrome affect the colon.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly
answering each question.

p. 330
Question 22

A patient presents to the emergency department and reports a bloated abdomen, jaundice,
and confusion. The nurse suspects that the patient has which medical condition?
© Heart failure

O Sepsis
rv) © Cirrhosis

O Dementia

That's right!

Rationale

Cirrhosis is a chronic state of liver disease in which the damage to the liver is beyond repair with scar tissue
and fatty infiltration. Based on the symptoms listed in the question, the patient is most likely showing
symptoms of cirrhosis. Abdominal bloating with free fluid is ascites, which results from protein-energy
malnutrition and vitamin/mineral deficiencies. Hepatic encephalopathy is a condition in which toxins in the
blood lead to alterations in brain homeostasis as a result of liver disease. Even though abdominal bloating
could be related to heart failure, jaundice is not associated with heart failure. Sepsis is a severe blood infection
and would present as fever, confusion, and alterations in vital signs. Dementia refers to the loss of memory.

pp. 338-339
Question 23

Which patient is likely to have a diagnosis of diverticular disease?

© A patient who has frequent lung infections and persistent steatorrhea
© A patient who reports headache, hives and abdominal pain after eating
© @ A patient who has frequent bouts of bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and nausea

@ © A patient who reports localized pain in the left lower side of the abdomen

So close!

Rationale

Diverticular disease is characterized by small pouches along the mucosal lining in the colon. A patient with
localized pain and tenderness in the lower left side of the abdomen, diarrhea, and fever is most likely suffering
from diverticular disease. A patient with frequent lung infections and steatorrhea would most likely have cystic
fibrosis. A patient who reports a headache, hives, and abdominal pain after eating may have a food
intolerance. A patient who has frequent bouts of bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and nausea may have ulcerative
colitis.

pp. 327, 330, 332, 334
Question 24

Which action is beneficial in the treatment of hiatal hernias?
Cy) O Recommend the use of antacids.

© Encourage regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for pain relief.
©) Advise patients to eat three large meals every day.

© ©@ Encourage relaxing in the supine position after eating.

So close!

Rationale

The frequent use of antacids helps to control the symptoms of heartburn and should be recommended.
NSAIDS are not recommended for hiatal hernias as they can damage the gastric mucosa. Clients should be
advised to eat small amounts of food at a time. Patients should also be advised to remain upright after eating
to prevent reflux of acidic stomach contents.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 323
Question 25

A patient admitted to the hospital for pneumonia has recently had unexplained drops in
food intake and gets fatigued while eating. The patient is suspected to have dysphagia.

Which intervention would be the most appropriate for the nurse to initiate first?

@ © Request a speech-language pathologist consultation.
© © Assist the patient with sitting in an upright position while eating.
© Request that the patient be ordered a mechanical soft diet.

© Educate the patient in using the chin-down position while drinking.

So close!

Rationale

The first intervention if dysphagia is suspected is to consult a speech-language pathologist. The speech-
language pathologist would then recommend swallowing techniques that help to prevent aspiration, such as
sitting in an upright position while eating and using chin-down positioning when drinking liquids. The type
of diet appropriate for the patient would be decided by the speech-language pathologist.

Test-Taking Tip: If the question asks for an immediate action or response, all of the answers may be correct, so

base your selection on identified priorities for action.

pp. 319-320
Question 26

An 87-year-old patient who is receiving radiation therapy for oral cancer has frequent
complaints of mouth lesions and pain with eating. Which action would the nurse take in
providing relief?
@ © Provide a medicated mouthwash to be used before eating.

© Recommend acidic foods to be consumed during meals.

© @ Provide cold foods during meals to prevent additional pain.

© Recommend that the patient start with soft foods and then progress to more-dense foods.

So close!

Rationale

The nurse would recommend a mouthwash that contains a mild topical local anesthetic before meals to help
relieve the irritation caused by eating. The nurse would recommend nonacidic and bland foods to avoid
irritation. Patients may prefer to avoid temperature extremes as well. Room temperature foods, not cold
foods, may be recommended. Patients should start with nutrient-dense liquids and then progress to soft

foods.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,

read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

pp. 317-318
Question 27

Which finding would the nurse expect in a patient with a malabsorption disorder resulting
from small intestinal disease? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Cy) | Steatorrhea

| Excessive bile secretion

Undergrowth of intestinal bacteria

°
Cy) | Inability to absorb nutrients
iV]

| Inability to digest macronutrients

So close!

Rationale

In a patient with a malabsorption disorder as a result of a small intestinal disease, the nurse may observe
steatorrhea, inability to absorb nutrients, and inability to digest macronutrients. Decreased bile secretion and
overgrowth of intestinal bacteria occur in major malabsorption syndromes.

p. 326
Question 28

Which is a risk factor for cholelithiasis? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.
Male

rv) m| Obesity
rv) mw] Diabetes
x) m| Dehydration

Postmenopausal

So close!

Rationale

The risk factors for cholelithiasis include obesity, diabetes, and being female. Dehydration is a risk factor for
urinary stone formation. Women who are of childbearing age are at a higher risk for cholelithiasis than are
postmenopausal women.

p. 340
Question 29

Which recommendation helps avoid stimulation of acid production in a patient with peptic

ulcer disease? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Avoiding chocolate

Avoiding smoking

|
m| Adhering to a bland diet
|

Eating small frequent meals

Including supplements high in iron

So close!

Rationale

A patient with peptic ulcer disease should avoid chocolate and smoking, and should eat small frequent meals
to avoid stimulation of acid production. Adhering to a bland diet is ineffective and provides little nutritional
support for the healing process. Supplements high in iron should be avoided because of the increased

oxidative stress that aggravates the disease process.

p. 326
Question 30

A patient has been diagnosed with an anaphylactic allergy to peanuts. Which intervention
would be appropriate after this diagnosis? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

m™| Educate them on reading nutrition labels.

Educate them on the use of an epinephrine autoinjector.

a
| Recommend avoiding the offending food.
a

Provide examples of nutritious substitutions.

Recommend obtaining a second opinion.

Refer the patient to a registered dietitian nutritionist.

So close!

Rationale

Providing family education on deciphering food labels is an important intervention relating to food allergies.
If anaphylaxis is a risk, as is with this patient, education on emergency care and the use of epinephrine in the
event of an anaphylactic reaction is paramount and can be life-saving. Recommend avoiding the offending
food and provide examples of nutritious substitutions. Referring the patient to a registered dietitian
nutritionist will provide family support, education, and counseling regarding a food allergy. A
recommendation to obtain a second opinion is not an appropriate intervention.

p. 335
Question 31

A patient who has celiac disease is requesting information about what can and cannot be
consumed. Which response would be appropriate?

O "You need to avoid all legumes."
O "Malt is grain that you are able to eat."
x) © “Buckwheat would be a grain to avoid."
rv) O "Soy and tapioca would be good substitutes for grains."

So close!

Rationale

The goal of nutrition management is to avoid all dietary sources of gluten and to prevent malnutrition
through healthy meal alternatives. Soy and tapioca, along with flax, millet, quinoa and rice, to name a few,
would be acceptable grains and grain-substitute plant foods. Legumes would be an acceptable alternative for a
patient with celiac disease. Wheat, rye, barley, and malt need to be eliminated from the diet. Buckwheat would
be an appropriate alternative.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

p. 336
Question 32

A patient is diagnosed with gallbladder disease and is requesting information about what
type of foods should be consumed. Which response is appropriate? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | "You can eat toast for breakfast with coffee."

| "You can eat chocolate and a small amount of nuts.”

"You can eat bacon, but try to limit your intake to three times per week."

m| "You can eat fat-free cottage cheese, and see if you can tolerate fresh fruit."

@ |B] "You can eat egg whites but should avoid the yolk."

So close!

Rationale

In patients with cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, the normal contraction of the gallbladder often causes pain as
fat enters the intestine. Medical nutrition therapy centers on controlling fat intake and eating small, frequent
meals. Low-fat diet options for a patient with gallbladder disease would include breads, coffee, egg whites, fat-
free cottage cheese, and fresh fruits, as tolerated. The patient would want to avoid chocolate and nuts. Bacon
is a high-fat food, so recommending that a patient limit intake to three times per week instead of avoiding it
would be inappropriate.

Question 33

A patient has recently been diagnosed with cholelithiasis. Which response would be
appropriate to explain the risk factors for the development cholelithiasis?

O "A diet high in salt increases the risk for gallstones."
O "Genetics do not play a role in the development of gallstones."
rv) © “Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk for gallstones."

O “Other medical history would not influence the development of gallstones."

That's right!

Rationale

The formation of gallstones is also known as cholelithiasis. Exogenous risk factors for cholelithiasis include
obesity, physical inactivity, hormone replacement therapy, and dietary factors such as a high intake of simple
carbohydrates and saturated fatty acids. A diet high in salt would not increase the risk for gallstones. Several
known genetic variants contribute to the pathology of gallstone formation. The risk for gallbladder disease

also increases in the presence of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and liver disease.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 340
Question 34

A patient is being discharged from a health care facility after being diagnosed with hepatitis.
Which discharge instruction is provided to the patient before discharge? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | "You will need to avoid alcohol."

| "Consume four to six small meals per day."

"You will need to avoid fat intake in your diet."

"Sodium intake should not exceed 3000 mg per day.”

@ |B] “Your diet should consist of mostly carbohydrates."

| "Protein intake should range from 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg of body weight daily."

So close!

Rationale

Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins. The goals of nutrition
therapy include avoiding hepatotoxic substances, including alcohol, drugs, and toxins; consuming four to six
small meals per day; consuming 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg of body weight of high quality protein if no complications are
present. Fat intake does not need to be entirely avoided but should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories.
Carbohydrates help to meet the energy demands of the disease and should supply about half of the patient’s
total kilocalories. Sodium should be limited to 2000 mg daily, not 3000 mg daily, to avoid fluid retention.

p. 338
Question 35

An antepartum patient is receiving education about the prevention of food allergies for the
baby. Which response by the nurse would be appropriate?

O "There is no way to prevent food allergies because it is purely genetic."
rv) © "Introduce allergenic foods between the first 4 and 6 months of the baby’s life."
O "It is important to avoid highly allergic foods while breastfeeding."

O "Breastfeeding for 4 to 6 months has not shown to be beneficial in preventing food allergies."

That's right!

Rationale

Many risk factors for the development of food allergies are not modifiable; however, some dietary factors
during pregnancy and early life may help to reduce the risk for food allergies in infancy. Introducing allergenic
foods between 4 and 6 months of age is recommended. There are some modifiable risk factors for the
development of food allergies. The breastfeeding mother should not avoid eating food allergens during
lactation. Breastfeeding is recommended for the first 4 to 6 months of life.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong
answer. Example: [f you are being asked to identify a diet that is specific to a certain condition, your knowledge about

that condition would help you choose the correct response (e.g., cholecystectomy = low-fat, high-protein, low-calorie

diet).

pp. 335-336
Question 36

A patient with a past history of cystic fibrosis comes to the clinic reporting very foul-
smelling stools and weight loss. Which question would the nurse ask?

O "Have you had a fever recently?"
O "Do you have an allergy to foods?"
rv) © "Do you take pancreatic enzymes?"

O "Have you been taking antibiotics recently2"

That's right!

Rationale

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal, recessive genetic disease that has a profound impact on the gastrointestinal
tract. Steatorrhea is also known as fatty diarrhea and can result from a lack of pancreatic enzymes in people
who are pancreatic insufficient who have cystic fibrosis. Steatorrhea can present as very foul-smelling stools
and can lead to weight loss due to malabsorption. Illness and fever would not lead to steatorrhea. Asking
about allergies is important in all patient visits but would not address this patient’s concerns. Antibiotic use is
not related to steatorrhea.

pp. 327, 328
Question 37

A patient reports trouble swallowing, and the nurse suspects achalasia. Which follow-up

question would the nurse ask?
rv) © "Do you vomit frequently?"

O "Do you belch excessively?"
O "How often do you drink alcohol?"

O "Do you have abdominal pain after eating?"

That's right!

Rationale

Symptoms of achalasia include difficulty swallowing, frequent vomiting, a feeling of fullness in the chest,
weight loss, malnutrition, and pulmonary complications. Belching excessively would indicate
gastroesophageal reflux disease. Asking about alcohol intake would be appropriate if recurrent peptic ulcers

were suspected. Abdominal pain after eating is a symptom of peptic ulcer disease.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices

will seem like the correct response.

pp. 321-322, 324, 325
Question 38

A patient is being evaluated at a primary health care provider's office and reports having a
dry mouth. Which response would the nurse provide to this patient?

O “Avoid chewing sugar-free gum.”
O "Limit the use of artificial saliva solutions."
rv) © "Suck on sugar-free hard candy between meals."

O "Limit the amount of fluid intake while eating."

That's right!

Rationale

A dry mouth from a lack of salivation may be temporary and caused by fear, infection, or a drug reaction. An
appropriate intervention for a patient who reports a dry mouth would be to have the patient suck on sugar-
free hard candy between meals to help the flow of saliva. Chewing sugar-free gum also helps improve the flow
of saliva. Spraying an artificial saliva solution inside the mouth may relieve extreme mouth dryness. The
addition of more liquid food items to regular meals may facilitate the eating process.

p. 319
Question 39

Which patient is most at risk for developing constipation?

© Recovering from brain surgery and ambulates in the hall
@ ©@ Recently had a cesarean section and is receiving opioids for pain
© Has a 5-year history of anxiety and drinks 64 oz of water daily

© Recently diagnosed with colon cancer and runs 5 miles daily

That's right!

Rationale

The patient who recently had a cesarean section and is receiving opioids for pain relief would be a highest risk
for constipation. Anesthesia received during the surgery, immobility after the surgery, and the use of pain
medications put this patient at highest risk. The patient who is recovering from brain surgery may also be at
risk, but the patient is lowering the risk by ambulating. The patient with anxiety is consuming an adequate
amount of fluids, which will help to lessen the risk. The patient who was diagnosed with colon cancer is very
active, which lowers the risk for constipation.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

p. 334
Question 40

Which action would the nurse take first after a new diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome?

© ©@ Educate the patient about triggers of symptoms.
© Recommend the use of prebiotics and probiotics.
@ © Create an individualized plan focusing on nutrition.

© Administer medications that the patient takes on a daily basis.

So close!

Rationale

Creating an individualized plan of care that focuses on nutrition would be the top priority after a patient is
first diagnosed. The individualized plan would include educating the patient about triggers of the symptoms,
possibly recommending the use of prebiotics and probiotics, and having the patient take medications to

control symptoms during flares.

pp. 333, 334
Question 41

A patient has recently been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF). Which action would be
appropriate for nutritional purposes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may

be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Recommend a low-fat diet.

| Provide nutrition counseling.

Recommend a high salt intake.

Recommend water-soluble vitamins.

| Screen for diabetes and liver disease.

| Encourage a diet including a variety of whole grains and fruits.

So close!

Rationale

Medical nutrition therapy is a critical component in the treatment of CF and includes encouraging patients to
eat a variety of whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables; providing nutrition counseling to discuss ideas for a
high-energy diet; recommending a high salt intake to replace the electrolytes lost through sweat, and
screening for CF-associated complications, including diabetes and liver disease. Patients with CF should

follow a high-fat diet and take fat-soluble vitamins to correct suboptimal levels.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

pp. 327, 328
Question 42

Which patient is likely to have a diagnosis of diverticular disease?

© A patient who has frequent lung infections and persistent steatorrhea
© A patient who reports headache, hives and abdominal pain after eating
© A patient who has frequent bouts of bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and nausea

@ ©@ A patient who reports localized pain in the left lower side of the abdomen

That's right!

Rationale

Diverticular disease is characterized by small pouches along the mucosal lining in the colon. A patient with
localized pain and tenderness in the lower left side of the abdomen, diarrhea, and fever is most likely suffering
from diverticular disease. A patient with frequent lung infections and steatorrhea would most likely have cystic
fibrosis. A patient who reports a headache, hives, and abdominal pain after eating may have a food
intolerance. A patient who has frequent bouts of bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and nausea may have ulcerative
colitis.

pp. 327, 330, 332, 334
Question 43

Which action is beneficial in the treatment of hiatal hernias?
Cy) O Recommend the use of antacids.

© Encourage regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for pain relief.
©) Advise patients to eat three large meals every day.

© ©@ Encourage relaxing in the supine position after eating.

So close!

Rationale

The frequent use of antacids helps to control the symptoms of heartburn and should be recommended.
NSAIDS are not recommended for hiatal hernias as they can damage the gastric mucosa. Clients should be
advised to eat small amounts of food at a time. Patients should also be advised to remain upright after eating
to prevent reflux of acidic stomach contents.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 323
Question 44

A patient admitted to the hospital for pneumonia has recently had unexplained drops in
food intake and gets fatigued while eating. The patient is suspected to have dysphagia.

Which intervention would be the most appropriate for the nurse to initiate first?

@ ©@ Request a speech-language pathologist consultation.
© Assist the patient with sitting in an upright position while eating.
© Request that the patient be ordered a mechanical soft diet.

© Educate the patient in using the chin-down position while drinking.

That's right!

Rationale

The first intervention if dysphagia is suspected is to consult a speech-language pathologist. The speech-
language pathologist would then recommend swallowing techniques that help to prevent aspiration, such as
sitting in an upright position while eating and using chin-down positioning when drinking liquids. The type
of diet appropriate for the patient would be decided by the speech-language pathologist.

Test-Taking Tip: If the question asks for an immediate action or response, all of the answers may be correct, so

base your selection on identified priorities for action.

pp. 319-320
Question 45

An 87-year-old patient who is receiving radiation therapy for oral cancer has frequent
complaints of mouth lesions and pain with eating. Which action would the nurse take in
providing relief?
@ ©@ Provide a medicated mouthwash to be used before eating.

© Recommend acidic foods to be consumed during meals.

© Provide cold foods during meals to prevent additional pain.

© Recommend that the patient start with soft foods and then progress to more-dense foods.

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse would recommend a mouthwash that contains a mild topical local anesthetic before meals to help
relieve the irritation caused by eating. The nurse would recommend nonacidic and bland foods to avoid
irritation. Patients may prefer to avoid temperature extremes as well. Room temperature foods, not cold
foods, may be recommended. Patients should start with nutrient-dense liquids and then progress to soft

foods.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,

read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

pp. 317-318
Question 46

Which finding would the nurse expect in a patient with a malabsorption disorder resulting
from small intestinal disease? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Steatorrhea

Excessive bile secretion

Cy) | Inability to absorb nutrients

Undergrowth of intestinal bacteria

Q@ [B] Inability to digest macronutrients

So close!

Rationale

In a patient with a malabsorption disorder as a result of a small intestinal disease, the nurse may observe
steatorrhea, inability to absorb nutrients, and inability to digest macronutrients. Decreased bile secretion and
overgrowth of intestinal bacteria occur in major malabsorption syndromes.

p. 326
Question 47

Which is a risk factor for cholelithiasis? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses
may be correct.
Male

rv) m| Obesity
rv) mw] Diabetes
Dehydration

Postmenopausal

That's right!

Rationale

The risk factors for cholelithiasis include obesity, diabetes, and being female. Dehydration is a risk factor for
urinary stone formation. Women who are of childbearing age are at a higher risk for cholelithiasis than are
postmenopausal women.

p. 340
Question 48

Which recommendation helps avoid stimulation of acid production in a patient with peptic
ulcer disease? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Avoiding chocolate

rv) | Avoiding smoking

Adhering to a bland diet

rv) m| Eating small frequent meals

Including supplements high in iron

That's right!

Rationale

A patient with peptic ulcer disease should avoid chocolate and smoking, and should eat small frequent meals
to avoid stimulation of acid production. Adhering to a bland diet is ineffective and provides little nutritional
support for the healing process. Supplements high in iron should be avoided because of the increased

oxidative stress that aggravates the disease process.

p. 326
Question 49

A patient has been diagnosed with an anaphylactic allergy to peanuts. Which intervention
would be appropriate after this diagnosis? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

m™| Educate them on reading nutrition labels.

Educate them on the use of an epinephrine autoinjector.

a
| Recommend avoiding the offending food.
a

Provide examples of nutritious substitutions.

Recommend obtaining a second opinion.

M™| Refer the patient to a registered dietitian nutritionist.

That's right!

Rationale

Providing family education on deciphering food labels is an important intervention relating to food allergies.
If anaphylaxis is a risk, as is with this patient, education on emergency care and the use of epinephrine in the
event of an anaphylactic reaction is paramount and can be life-saving. Recommend avoiding the offending
food and provide examples of nutritious substitutions. Referring the patient to a registered dietitian
nutritionist will provide family support, education, and counseling regarding a food allergy. A
recommendation to obtain a second opinion is not an appropriate intervention.

p. 335
Question 50

A patient who has celiac disease is requesting information about what can and cannot be

consumed. Which response would be appropriate?

O "You need to avoid all legumes."
O "Malt is grain that you are able to eat."
O “Buckwheat would be a grain to avoid."

rv) © "Soy and tapioca would be good substitutes for grains."

That's right!

Rationale

The goal of nutrition management is to avoid all dietary sources of gluten and to prevent malnutrition
through healthy meal alternatives. Soy and tapioca, along with flax, millet, quinoa and rice, to name a few,
would be acceptable grains and grain-substitute plant foods. Legumes would be an acceptable alternative for a
patient with celiac disease. Wheat, rye, barley, and malt need to be eliminated from the diet. Buckwheat would
be an appropriate alternative.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

p. 336
Question 51

A patient is diagnosed with gallbladder disease and is requesting information about what
type of foods should be consumed. Which response is appropriate? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | "You can eat toast for breakfast with coffee."

"You can eat chocolate and a small amount of nuts."

@ |B] "You can eat egg whites but should avoid the yolk."

"You can eat bacon, but try to limit your intake to three times per week."

@ [BB] “You can eat fat-free cottage cheese, and see if you can tolerate fresh fruit."

That's right!

Rationale

In patients with cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, the normal contraction of the gallbladder often causes pain as
fat enters the intestine. Medical nutrition therapy centers on controlling fat intake and eating small, frequent
meals. Low-fat diet options for a patient with gallbladder disease would include breads, coffee, egg whites, fat-
free cottage cheese, and fresh fruits, as tolerated. The patient would want to avoid chocolate and nuts. Bacon
is a high-fat food, so recommending that a patient limit intake to three times per week instead of avoiding it

would be inappropriate.

p. 341
Question 52

A patient is being discharged from a health care facility after being diagnosed with hepatitis.
Which discharge instruction is provided to the patient before discharge? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | "You will need to avoid alcohol."

@ |B] "Consume four to six small meals per day."

"You will need to avoid fat intake in your diet."

"Your diet should consist of mostly carbohydrates."

"Sodium intake should not exceed 3000 mg per day.”

@ |B] "Protein intake should range from 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg of body weight daily."

That's right!

Rationale

Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins. The goals of nutrition
therapy include avoiding hepatotoxic substances, including alcohol, drugs, and toxins; consuming four to six
small meals per day; consuming 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg of body weight of high quality protein if no complications are

be correct.

Recommend a low-fat diet.

Provide nutrition counseling.

Recommend a high salt intake.

Recommend water-soluble vitamins.

Screen for diabetes and liver disease.

Encourage a diet including a variety of whole grains and fruits.

That's right!

Rationale

Medical nutrition therapy is a critical component in the treatment of CF and includes encouraging patients to
eat a variety of whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables; providing nutrition counseling to discuss ideas for a
high-energy diet; recommending a high salt intake to replace the electrolytes lost through sweat, and
screening for CF-associated complications, including diabetes and liver disease. Patients with CF should

follow a high-fat diet and take fat-soluble vitamins to correct suboptimal levels.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked

Question 56

Which is an expected assessment finding in a patient diagnosed with irritable bowel

syndrome (IBS)? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

®| Vomiting

| Diarrhea

| Steatorrhea

Constipation

| Abdominal bloating

So close!

Rationale

Expected assessment findings in a patient diagnosed with IBS include diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal
bloating. Vomiting and steatorrhea are not typical findings associated with IBS.

p. 334
Question 57

Which food most commonly triggers allergic and immune-based responses in children?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [| Milk
[| soy
@ Im Eggs
Rice
@ [B| Wheat
© |B) Bananas

So close!

Rationale
Foods that most commonly trigger allergic and immune-based responses in children include milk, soy, eggs,
wheat, peanuts, and tree nuts. Although children may have allergic reactions to other foods such as rice or

bananas, this is not common.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 334
Question 58

Which component in milk is an allergen for those with food allergies?

O Vitamin D

Cy) © Protein

That's right!

Rationale
A milk allergy is caused by the protein in the milk. Patients may be intolerant to lactose but not truly allergic.

Calcium and vitamin D are not responsible for milk allergies.

p. 334
Question 59

Which statement about dietary considerations for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is
accurate?

O Patients with CF need to eat foods low in calories and fat.
O Patients with CF should receive a liquid diet to rest the bowel.
rv) © Patients with CF require increased calories and fat intake.

O Patients with CF should not receive snacks.

That's right!

Rationale

The focus of nutritional intervention for patients with CF include increased calorie intake, increased fat intake,
and maintenance of lean body mass. Dietary recommended intakes (DRIs) for patients with CF over 2 years of
age may require more nutrients (110% to 200%) depending on the severity of the disease. A liquid diet would
not provide enough nutritional value, and bowel rest is not necessary for cystic fibrosis. Patients with cystic
fibrosis should receive three meals and two to three snacks per day.

p. 328
Question 60

A patient asks the nurse, "What keeps causing these canker sores?" What is the nurse’s best
response?

O "Your sores are a caused by lack of oral hygiene."
O "Your canker sores are caused by a herpes simplex virus."
O "That is thrush caused by the fungus Candida albicans."

rv) © "They are caused by bacteria known as hemolytic Streptococcus."

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse’s best response to the patient is "They are caused by a bacteria known as hemolytic Streptococcus." A
canker sore is not caused by lack of oral hygiene. Herpes simplex virus does not cause canker sores, but it
does cause mouth sores known as cold sores or fever blisters on the inside mucous lining of the lips and

cheeks or on the external portion of the lips. Thrush is caused by the fungus Candida albicans, which can cause
similar sores on the oral mucosa.

p. 318
Question 61

A patient with Crohn's disease presents to the emergency department with watery diarrhea.
Which diet would be most helpful to the patient?

O Low-protein, low-calorie
O High-carbohydrate, low-protein
O Increased fiber

rv) © High-protein, low-fat, lactose-free

That's right!

Rationale

A patient experiencing watery diarrhea caused by Crohn's disease would benefit from increased proteins and
calories, low fats and lactose, and avoidance of foods that stimulate peristalsis. Increased protein will help the
patient’s overall strength and nutritional health. Increasing carbohydrates but reducing protein is not best for

this patient. Increasing fiber is not enough for this patient.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly
answering each question.

p. 331
Question 62

Which assessment finding is associated with a diagnosis of diverticulitis? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Fever

Vasculitis

rv) | Bloody diarrhea

rv) m| Nausea and vomiting

Pain and tenderness in the lower right abdomen

That's right!

Rationale

Fever, bloody diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting are findings associated with diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a
result of the diverticula becoming infected. Vasculitis is an inflammatory complication of cystic fibrosis. Pain

and tenderness occur in the lower left abdomen in the patient with diverticulitis.

p. 332
Question 63

Which dietary management principle should be applied during periods of inflammation for
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

x) © Implementing high-fiber meals
rv) O Providing low-fat meals
O Increasing antioxidant intake

O Initiating total parenteral nutrition

So close!

Rationale

The nurse should provide low-fat meals to patients with IBD during periods of inflammation. Foods high in
fat can cause gas and diarrhea during periods of inflammation caused by inadequate absorption of fat. High-
fiber meals should be avoided during periods of inflammation. Increasing antioxidant intake is initiated

during the period of remission. Total parenteral nutrition is initiated only if necessary.

p. 331
Question 64

Which action will increase the lower esophageal sphincter pressure to help alleviate the

symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?
rv) O Avoiding high-fat meals

O Avoiding carbonated beverages
x) © Consuming adequate fiber and water

O Sipping small amounts of liquids with meals

So close!

Rationale

Avoiding high-fat meals will increase the lower esophageal sphincter pressure to help alleviate the symptoms
of GERD. Avoiding carbonated beverages decreases esophageal irritation. Consuming fiber and water prevent
constipation. Sipping small amounts of liquids with meals causes a decrease in reflux frequency and volume.

p. 322
Question 65

Which of the following is a common cause of acute hepatitis A?
@ ©@ Contaminated food or water

© Sharing intravenous needles
©, Unprotected sexual intercourse

O Contaminated blood transfusion

That's right!

Rationale
Hepatitis A is most commonly caused by contaminated food or water sources. Hepatitis B and C can be

caused by sharing intravenous needles, unprotected sexual intercourse, and contaminated blood transfusions.

p. 338
Question 66

How many grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is recommended for a patient

with ascites and cirrhosis?

rv) O 0.8 to 1.2 g/kg
x) © 1.5 to 3 g/kg

O 2.0 to 3.5 g/kg
O 2.3 to 4.0 g/kg

So close!

Rationale

For a patient with ascites and cirrhosis, protein intake should be 0.8 to 1.2 g/kg to treat malnutrition. Intake
amounts of 1.5 to 3 g/kg, 2.0 to 3.5 g/kg, or 2.3 to 4.0 g/kg would be too high.

p. 340
Question 67

Which meal does the nurse recommend for a patient with cholecystitis?

O Grilled fish, avocado, potatoes
© Grilled lamb, broccoli cheese soup

© Fried eggs, bacon, toast with peanut butter
Cy) © Roasted chicken, broccoli, angel food cake

That's right!

Rationale
A patient with cholecystitis should have low-fat meals, such as roasted chicken, broccoli, and angel food cake.
Avocado, broccoli cheese soup, fried eggs, bacon, and peanut butter are all high-fat foods that this patient

should avoid.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 341
Question 68

Which diet is recommended for the patient with acute pancreatitis?
© ©@ low-fat

© High-protein
@ © Nothing by mouth

© High-carbohydrate

So close!

Rationale

With acute pancreatitis, the patient’s diet will be nothing by mouth to allow the pancreas to rest. For patients
with chronic pancreatitis, the diet should be low in fat and high in protein. A high-carbohydrate diet is not
recommended for patients with pancreatitis.

Question 69

Which is an expected assessment finding in a patient diagnosed with irritable bowel

syndrome (IBS)? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Vomiting
rv) mw) Diarrhea

Steatorrhea

rv) | Constipation

rv) m| Abdominal bloating

That's right!

Rationale

Expected assessment findings in a patient diagnosed with IBS include diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal
bloating. Vomiting and steatorrhea are not typical findings associated with IBS.

Question 70

Which food most commonly triggers allergic and immune-based responses in children?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) ml] Milk

| Soy

@
rv) m| Eggs
@

Rice

mw) Wheat

Bananas

That's right!

Rationale
Foods that most commonly trigger allergic and immune-based responses in children include milk, soy, eggs,
wheat, peanuts, and tree nuts. Although children may have allergic reactions to other foods such as rice or

bananas, this is not common.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 1
—

Which condition is marked by the weakened heart muscle’s inability to maintain adequate

cardiac output to sustain normal blood circulation?

O Hypertension
O Myocardial ischemia

O Myocardial infarction
rv) © Congestive heart failure

That's right!

Rationale

Congestive heart failure is a condition in which a progressively weakened heart muscle, the myocardium, is
unable to maintain adequate cardiac output to sustain normal blood circulation. Hypertension is a risk factor
for congestive heart failure. Myocardial ischemia is the most common cause of congestive heart failure.
Myocardial infarction is a heart attack.

p. 353
Question 2
a

Which term describes the accumulation of fluid in lung tissue?

O Necrosis

@ @ Pulmonary edema
© Respiratory distress

© Myocardial ischemia

That's right!

Rationale

Pulmonary edema describes accumulation of fluid in lung tissue. Necrosis is tissue death. Respiratory distress
is difficulty in breathing caused by pulmonary edema. Myocardial ischemia occurs when blood flow to the
heart is reduced.

p. 353
Question 3
a

Increased levels of which type of lipoprotein are a risk factor for atherosclerosis and why?

@ ©@ Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are a risk factor because they carry cholesterol to tissues.
© High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a risk factor because they carry cholesterol to the liver.
© Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are a risk factor because they are formed from endogenous fat.

© Intermediate-density lipoproteins are a risk factor because they remain in the circulation after
degradation of VLDLs.

That's right!

Rationale

Increased levels of LDLs are a risk factor for atherosclerosis because they carry cholesterol to tissues, where it
may be deposited in the form of plaque. HDLs are considered beneficial because they carry cholesterol to the
liver for catabolism. High levels of all non-high-density lipoproteins are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, but

not as a result of being formed from endogenous fat or remaining in circulation after degradation of VLDLs.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five

consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p. 347
Question 4
Es

Which step or goal of medical nutrition therapy is appropriate for a patient who is

recovering from myocardial infarction (MI)? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Promote recovery and strength.

Provide support in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and other known risk factors to
prevent additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

Administer MONA ( Morphine, supplemental Oxygen, intravenous Nitroglycerin, and Aspirin)
protocol.

Initiate a Mediterranean diet.

Limit fluid consumption to 1.2 L per day.

That's right!

Rationale

Medical nutrition therapy goals for patients after MI are to promote recovery and strength and provide

support in lowering LDL cholesterol levels and other known risk factors to prevent additional cardiovascular

events. The Mediterranean and DASH diets are appropriate long-term eating plans for patients with

cardiovascular disease who have suffered an MI. Immediately after an MI, the health care team may treat the

patient with the MONA protocol, which is drug therapy. Fluid is limited to 2 L per day for individuals with

serum sodium levels of less than 130 mEq/L.

pp. 352-353
Question 5

— Es
Which lipoprotein transports cholesterol from the tissues and arteries back to the liver for
catabolism?

O Chylomicrons

rv) © High-density lipoproteins (HDLs)
O Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)

O Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs)

That's right!

Rationale

HDLs transport cholesterol from the tissue and arteries back to the liver for catabolism. Chylomicrons
transport absorbed dietary fat to plasma and tissues, primarily the liver. LDLs are formed endogenously by the
liver and deliver cholesterol to tissues. IDLs deliver triglycerides, not cholesterol, to cells and tissues
throughout the body.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,

read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 347
Question 6

Which blood test results indicate the highest risk for atherosclerosis?

@ © low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 180 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 39
mg/dL

© ©@ LDL cholesterol, 150 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol, 49 mg/dL
© LDL cholesterol, 39 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol, 180 mg/dL
© LDL cholesterol, 49 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol, 150 mg/dL

So close!

Rationale
The blood test results indicating the highest risk for atherosclerosis are LDL cholesterol, 180 mg/dL, and HDL

cholesterol, 39 mg/dL. The other three sets of results are outside of the high-risk range for atherosclerosis.

p. 347
Question 7

Which category of hypertension has an identifiable cause and is a symptom or side effect of
another primary condition?

O Primary hypertension
O Essential hypertension

O Resistant hypertension

rv) © Secondary hypertension

That's right!

Rationale

Secondary hypertension is elevated blood pressure for which the cause can be identified and is a symptom or
side effect of another primary condition. Primary or essential hypertension is an inherent form of high blood
pressure with no specific identifiable cause; it is considered to be familial. Resistant hypertension is the

presence of high blood pressure despite treatment with three antihypertensive medications.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five

consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p. 360
Question &
|

For which set of risk factors does the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association Guidelines on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommend drug therapy
to manage low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

No risk factors associated with cardiovascular (CVD) and an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg/dL

| Age of 75 years or younger with CVD or multiple risk factors

| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction resulting from ischemic heart disease and a reasonable
life expectancy

| Asingle risk factor for CVD and a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level of 50 mg/dL

Few or no risk factors associated with CVD and LDL cholesterol levels exceeding 190 mg/dL

So close!

Rationale

Drug therapy would be recommended for a person age 75 years or younger with CVD or multiple risk factors.
Drug therapy would also be recommended for a person with heart failure who has a reduced ejection fraction
resulting from ischemic heart disease and a reasonable life expectancy. A person with few or no risk factors
associated with CVD and an LDL cholesterol level exceeding 190 mg/dL would meet the criteria for drug
therapy. However, a person with no risk factors associated with CVD and an LDL cholesterol level of 100
mg/dL may wait to initiate drug therapy until LDL cholesterol levels exceed 190 mg/dL. HDL cholesterol is
considered good cholesterol, and an HDL level of 50 mg/dL is within the normal range. So, a single risk factor
for CVD and an HDL cholesterol level of 50 mg/dL are not criteria for drug therapy for managing LDL
cholesterol levels.

p. 352
Question 9

How do the kidneys exacerbate edema in the patient with congestive heart failure?

© By increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
© Byallowing protein to pass into the tubule from the glomerulus
© By upregulating the conversion of inactive vitamin D into active vitamin D hormone

@ © By triggering the vasopressin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems to increase blood pressure

That's right!

Rationale

In the patient with congestive heart failure, kidney nephrons sense decreased renal blood flow, which is
normally an indication of dehydration and hypovolemia, and they respond by triggering the vasopressin and
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems to increase blood pressure. Consequently, fluid retention is increased,
and edema is exacerbated. The GFR is decreased in kidney disease. Protein is allowed to pass through the
glomerulus into the tubule as a result of nephrosis. The kidneys convert inactive vitamin D into active vitamin
D, but this process is not upregulated in the patient with congestive heart failure.

p. 355
Question 10

Which daily fluid intake level is recommended for the patient with congestive heart failure

whose serum sodium levels are less than 130 mEq/L?

O@® iL
OO 2L
© 3L
O4t

So close!

Rationale
Fluid is limited to 2 L per day for patients with serum sodium levels of less than 130 mEq/L in order to avoid

exacerbating edema. Daily intake of 1 L is too little; 3 or 4 L daily is too much.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 355
Question 11

Which is the recommended daily sodium intake limit for the patient with congestive heart

failure?
O ls

O® 7s
O 38
O 48

That's right!

Rationale

The recommended daily sodium intake limit for the patient with congestive heart failure is 2 g. Patients with

congestive heart failure can consume more than 1 g of sodium, but 3 g and 4 g are too much.

p. 355
Question 12

Which disease process is associated with elevated serum cholesterol levels, low levels of
high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and high levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)?
©) Diabetes mellitus
rv) © Coronary heart disease
©) Cirrhosis
O Chronic kidney disease

That's right!

Rationale

Coronary heart disease is associated with elevated serum cholesterol levels, low levels of HDLs, and high
levels of LDLs. Diabetes mellitus results in an abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates. Cirrhosis develops
when scar tissue replaces normal liver tissue and is often associated with alcohol abuse. Chronic kidney

disease is a gradual loss of renal function.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five
consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p. 346
Question 13

The nurse is teaching a patient about risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Which
risk factor cannot be modified by lifestyle changes?

O Obesity
O Smoking

rv) © Advanced age

O Physical inactivity

That's right!

Rationale

Age cannot be modified. Advanced age increases a patient’s risk for CHD. Obesity, smoking, and physical
inactivity are modifiable risk factors.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 348
Question 14

The student nurse is providing discharge instructions to a patient newly diagnosed with
cardiovascular disease. Which instruction given by the student nurse requires correction?

O "Choose 2 to 4 servings of fresh fruit per day."

O "Choose 3 to 5 servings of fresh vegetables per day."
rv) © "Choose white bread over whole grains."

O "Choose fat-free or low-fat milk."

That's right!

Rationale

The student nurse requires correction when advising the patient to choose white bread over whole grains. The
patient should choose whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and low-fat or fat-free milk.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 363
Question 15

Which dietary restriction is necessary for safe administration of atorvastatin?
© Avoid taking with food

@ © Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice
© Avoid apples or apple juice

© Avoid strawberries or strawberry jelly

That's right!

Rationale

Patients taking statin drugs, such as atorvastatin, should avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice because these
may affect the rate at which the medication is absorbed by the liver, causing side effects ranging from mild
muscle pain to severe kidney failure. Atorvastatin can be taken with or without food. Apples and strawberries
do not interfere with this drug.

p. 359
Question 16

Which is the major cause and underlying pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease?

O Hypertension

Cy) © Atherosclerosis

© Myocardial infarction

© Hypercholesterolemia

That's right!

Rationale

The major cause and underlying pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis. Hypertension,
myocardial infarction, and hypercholesterolemia are all complicating factors but are not the major cause of
cardiovascular disease.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 345
Question 17

Which dietary substance involved in the atherogenic disease process carries fat in the

bloodstream?

O Chyme

O Cholesterol

rv) © Lipoproteins

O Triglycerides

That's right!

Rationale

Because fat is not soluble in water, it is carried in the bloodstream in small packages wrapped with protein
called lipoproteins. Chyme is the semifluid food mass in the gastrointestinal tract that is present after gastric
digestion. Cholesterol is a fat-related compound called a sterol. Triglycerides are fats in the body or in food

composed of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol base.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 346
Question 18

Which are the principles of medical nutrition therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF)?
© Limiting sodium, potassium, and fluids in the diet

© Achieving a positive fluid balance and limiting sodium intake

@ © Achieving adequate nutrition, limiting sodium intake, and controlling edema

© Increasing fluid intake and lowering serum sodium levels

That's right!

Rationale

The principles of medical nutrition therapy for CHF include achieving adequate nutrition, limiting sodium

intake, and controlling edema. Limiting potassium may result in hypokalemia if the patient is treated with a
loop diuretic. A positive fluid balance means there is more fluid being taken in than being excreted, which is a
problem with CHF. Increasing fluid intake will further exacerbate CHF, a condition with fluid volume excess.

p. 355
Question 19

Which dietary mineral should be reduced in the patient with congestive heart failure?
O Zinc
@ @ Sodium

O Potassium

O Magnesium

That's right!

Rationale

Medical nutrition therapy for the patient with congestive heart failure focuses on achieving nutritional
adequacy of the diet by limiting sodium and fluid intake to control edema. It is not recommended to limit

zinc, potassium, or magnesium.

p. 355
Question 20

Which element comprises a plaque that forms inside artery walls? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) wl Fibrin

Pepsin
rv) ml] Calcium

Potassium

rv) mw] Cholesterol

That's right!

Rationale
A plaque that forms inside artery walls is composed of fibrin, calcium, cholesterol, fatty substances, and

cellular debris. It is not composed of pepsin or potassium.

p. 345
Question 21

Which is the effect of altered fluid-shift mechanisms in a patient with congestive heart

failure?
O Decreased fluid retention

O Excretion of large amounts of dilute urine
rv) © Fluid collection within intracellular spaces

O Reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

That's right!

Rationale

With decreased heart function, blood accumulates in the vascular system. This buildup offsets the delicate
balance of filtration pressures and causes fluid to collect within intracellular spaces instead of flowing into
fluid compartments. Fluid retention increases as a result of hormonal alterations. Excretion of large amounts

of dilute urine occurs during the early stages of kidney failure. Reduction in GFR occurs in kidney disease.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 353
Question 22

Which incident may occur as a result of coronary artery blood flow to the heart being
completely occluded?
© Thrombus

O Angina pectoris
rv) © Myocardial infarction

O Cerebrovascular accident

That's right!

Rationale

If blood flow to the heart is completely occluded, myocardial infarction may occur. A thrombus is a blood clot
that can cause the occlusion of blood flow. Angina pectoris may occur if blood flow is partially occluded. A

cerebrovascular accident may occur if blood flow is occluded in a cerebral artery.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 346
Question 23

What is the nurse’s best response to a patient who asks, "What can you recommend for

seasoning chicken soup if | cannot eat sodium?"

rv) © "Use salt alternatives, such as thyme, savory, ginger, white pepper, cloves, or allspice, to flavor your
chicken soup."

© "Just sprinkle a very small amount of salt in your soup, and you should be fine."

©) "Use Italian seasonings, such as nutmeg, oregano, basil, red pepper, and tarragon, to flavor your
chicken soup."

© "Just eat the chicken soup without any seasoning. You'll get used to it."

That's right!

Rationale

The patient should be encouraged to use a salt alternative. Salt alternatives that may pair well with chicken
soup include thyme, savory, ginger, white pepper, cloves, and allspice. The patient should not be encouraged
to eat any amount of salt. Italian seasonings, such as nutmeg, oregano, basil, red pepper, and tarragon, are

better suited for pasta, beans, or rice dishes. Eating soup without seasoning may not help the patient comply
with the diet.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; however, every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p. 356
Question 24

The nurse is teaching a patient with coronary artery disease about following the
Mediterranean diet. Which statement made by the patient indicates that teaching was

successful?

© "Iwill increase dairy products, such as whole milk and cottage cheese."
© "Iwill eat pork at least four times per week and limit butter."
@ ©@ "Iwill eat more fruits and vegetables and replace saturated fats with olive oil."

© "Iwill increase carbohydrates and proteins in my diet."

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse knows the teaching was successful when the patient states, "| will eat more fruits and vegetables
and replace saturated fats with olive oil." Adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduces risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, reduces levels of inflammatory markers following myocardial infarction, and increases
the life span. Low-fat milk should be consumed rather than whole milk. Eating pork four times per week is
excessive, though limiting butter intake is healthy. Increasing carbohydrates may cause a rise in low-density
lipoproteins.

p. 353
Question 25

Which statement made by the patient indicates understanding of the dietary
recommendations to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease?

O "| will avoid plant-based proteins, such as whole grains or legumes.”
rv) O "| will substitute polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats."

O "| will avoid egg whites, whole grains, nuts, and dry beans."
x) © "| will include whole foods, such as whole milk, in my diet."

So close!

Rationale

Dietary recommendations for prevention of heart disease include substituting polyunsaturated fats (e.g.,
vegetable oils) for saturated fats (e.g., butter). Plant-based proteins, such as whole grains or legumes are
encouraged over animal proteins. Egg whites are preferred over egg yolks. Low-fat dairy products are

preferred over whole milk, which is high in fat.

p. 351
Question 26

Which step taken during the purchase of food helps ensure sound food habits? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Read information provided by the food label on the product.

Seek foods high in trans fat.

Ensure the frequent purchase of processed foods.

m| Ensure the purchase of fresh foods.

m| Purchase primarily whole foods.

That's right!

Rationale

An important part of purchasing food is carefully reading food labels. The Nutrition Facts labels provide basic
nutrition information in a standard format that is easily recognized and clearly expressed. For a healthy diet,
use fresh, whole foods primarily, with a limited selection of processed foods when necessary. Ensure food is
prepared with little to no trans fat.

p. 362
Question 27

Which food helps train taste preferences to adapt to a lowered sodium intake? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) ™| Lemon
Grilled chicken

Onion

Butter

iV]

Nonfat milk and yogurt
iV] yog
iv)

mw] Garlic

So close!

Rationale

Many seasonings, such as lemon, onion, garlic, nonfat milk and yogurt, wine, fat-free/low-sodium broth,
herbs, and spices, can help to train taste preferences for a lower-sodium diet. Grilled chicken and butter do

not train taste preferences to adapt to a lowered sodium intake.

p. 363
Question 28

Which phrase describes a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood
pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg?

rv) O Stage 1 hypertension

x) © Stage 2 hypertension
O Elevated blood pressure

O Normal blood pressure

So close!

Rationale

Stage 1 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood
pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is classified as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or
greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater. Elevated blood pressure, also known as
prehypertension, is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 129 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure
of less than 80 mm Hg. Normal blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm
Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item

writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

p. 358
Question 29

Which factor significantly increases the risk for heart failure? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

m| Coronary artery disease

Obesity

a
m| Cigarette smoking
a

Hypertension

High-fiber diet

mw] Diabetes

That's right!

Rationale

The most significant risk factors for heart failure are coronary artery disease, obesity, cigarette smoking,
hypertension, and diabetes. A high-fiber diet is not a risk factor for heart failure.

p. 353
Question 30

Which description of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet eating plan
would the nurse provide to a patient who was recently diagnosed with stage 2
hypertension?

Cy) O Eat lean meats, beans, and nuts.
© Eat low-fiber grains and low-sodium foods.
© Eat four servings of low-fat dairy foods per day.

© ©@ Lat three servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables per day.

So close!

Rationale

The DASH diet is the result of the DASH landmark study, in which blood pressure was significantly lowered by
diet alone over 2 weeks. The DASH diet recommends eating lean meats, beans, and nuts. The diet
recommends eating high-fiber, not low-fiber, foods and low-sodium foods. It also recommends eating two to
three servings of low-fat dairy foods per day, not four servings. Further, the diet recommends eating four to

six servings of fruits and four to six servings of vegetables per day, not three servings.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

pp. 360-361
Question 31

A patient’s blood pressure is 134/83 mm Hg at a yearly well-care visit. Which phrase

describes this blood pressure measurement?

rv) © Stage 1 hypertension
O Stage 2 hypertension

O Elevated blood pressure

O Normal blood pressure

That's right!

Rationale

Common blood pressure measurements indicate the pressure of the blood surge in the arteries of the upper
arm with each heartbeat. A blood pressure of 134/83 mm Hg would be categorized as stage 1 hypertension.
Stage 1 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood
pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is classified as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or
greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater. Elevated blood pressure, also known as
prehypertension, is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 129 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure
of less than 80 mm Hg. Normal blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm
Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be very helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best
choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which
one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

pp. 357-358
Question 32

Which patient has the highest risk for atherosclerosis?
© A 60-year-old Caucasian man with high levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol

@ © A55-year-old postmenopausal African American woman
© A 40-year-old man with poor diet quality and high levels of inflammatory markers

© ©@ 4 35-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 and a history of cigarette smoking

So close!

Rationale

The 55-year-old postmenopausal African American woman has the highest risk for atherosclerosis. Her age
and race put her at a higher risk than the others. Although men have a greater risk of developing
atherosclerosis than do women, the relative risks are similar for both sexes after women reach menopause.
High levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol are protective against atherosclerosis. Poor diet quality,

high levels of inflammatory markers, high BMI, and cigarette smoking are modifiable risk factors that could
impact risk, particularly for men and women in their 30s and early 40s.

p. 348
Question 33

The nurse is reviewing the medical record of a patient admitted to the hospital with
cardiovascular disease. Which statement made by the patient is the nurse’s highest priority

for addressing?
© "My cholesterol level last week was 199 mg/dL."

© "My body mass index (BMI) is 19.0 kg/m a
@ © "My father died of a heart attack."
© @ "My mother has diabetes and high blood pressure."

So close!

Rationale

There is a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease. The patient’s father (a first-degree relative)
died of a coronary event, increasing the patient’s risk for a heart attack. A total cholesterol level of less than
200 mg/dL is considered optimal. A BMI of 19.0 kg/m 2 is normal. The fact that the patient’s mother has
diabetes and high blood pressure increases the patient’s risk for those illnesses, but they are of a less-

immediate concern in this scenario.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 348
Question 34

A patient with a history of atherosclerosis is admitted to the coronary care unit after
myocardial infarction. Which diet order does the nurse anticipate for this patient?
rv) O Liquid diet as tolerated

x) © Low-sodium diet
O Low-fat, high-protein diet

O Meals supplemented with Ensure

So close!

Rationale

The focus of a patient with myocardial infarction is to reduce the workload of the heart. As such, the patient is
placed on liquids and may progress food consistency as tolerated. A low-sodium diet is recommended for
patients with hypertension. Low-fat, high-protein diets are optimal for patients recovering from surgery or

those with depleted energy stores. Supplementing meals with Ensure is usually recommended for patients
with poor oral intake.

p. 353
Question 35

The nurse is reviewing medical records of patients on the unit. Which patient is displaying

signs of metabolic syndrome?

x) © Male: blood pressure, 140/88 mm Hg; triglycerides, 157 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol, 60 mg/dL

© Female: waist circumference, 40 in; blood pressure, 110/70 mm Hg; HDL cholesterol, 55 mg/dL
© Male: triglycerides, 200 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol, 30 mg/dL; fasting blood glucose, 90 mg/dL
@ © Female: blood pressure, 138/88 mm Hg; waist circumference, 37 in; HDL cholesterol, 40 mg/dL

So close!

Rationale

Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that increase the risk for heart disease, diabetes mellitus,
peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Patients with at least three of the following risk factors are said to have
metabolic syndrome: Abdominal obesity (waist circumference of 40 in or more for men and 35 in or more for
women); elevated triglycerides (150 mg/dL or greater); reduced HDL cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL for men
and less than 50 mg/dL for women); elevated blood pressure (135/85 mm Hg or greater); and elevated fasting
blood glucose (100 mg/dL or greater). As such, the female patient with the blood pressure of 138/88 mm Hg,
waist circumference of 37 in, and HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dL meets the criteria for metabolic syndrome.
The other patients do not meet at least three criteria of metabolic syndrome. One of the male patients has a
normal HDL cholesterol (60 mg/dL), the other male has a fasting blood glucose level within normal limits,

and the female patient with the waist circumference of 40 in meets only one criteria for metabolic syndrome.

Question 36

Which statement made by the patient indicates understanding of the dietary
recommendations to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease?

O "| will avoid plant-based proteins, such as whole grains or legumes.”
rv) © "| will substitute polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats."
O "| will avoid egg whites, whole grains, nuts, and dry beans."

O "| will include whole foods, such as whole milk, in my diet."

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary recommendations for prevention of heart disease include substituting polyunsaturated fats (e.g.,
vegetable oils) for saturated fats (e.g., butter). Plant-based proteins, such as whole grains or legumes are
encouraged over animal proteins. Egg whites are preferred over egg yolks. Low-fat dairy products are

preferred over whole milk, which is high in fat.

p. 351
Question 37

Which statement by a patient following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) diet indicates to the nurse more teaching is needed?
O "| eat nuts and grains regularly.”

O "| eat five servings of fruit every day."
rv) © "| eat four servings of low-fat dairy daily."

O "| eat lean meats and avoid red meats."

That's right!

Rationale

The DASH diet has been shown to lower blood pressure significantly in a 2-week period by diet alone. A
patient who consumes four servings of low-fat dairy per day is exceeding the recommendation of the DASH
diet and would require additional teaching by the nurse. The recommendation for low-fat dairy intake is two
to three servings per day. The patient indicating that nuts and grains are consumed regularly is following the
guidelines of this diet. The DASH diet recommends eating four to six servings of fruits and four to six servings

of vegetables per day. Lean meats are recommended for consumption as part of the diet.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

pp. 360-361
Question 38

Which teaching would the nurse include when providing education about lifestyle
modifications that will help lower blood pressure to a patient diagnosed with stage 1

hypertension?
© "Try to reduce your weight by at least 2 kg ."

© "Exercise for 30 minutes every day."
@ © "Eat 3500 to 5000 mg of potassium per day."

© @ "Do not consume more than 2000 mg of sodium per day."

So close!

Rationale

The best proven lifestyle interventions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension include consuming
3500 to 5000 mg of potassium per day because there is an inverse association between potassium intake and
blood pressure. Excess weight is closely associated with hypertension risk factors; however, the recommended
weight loss would be 1 kg (2.2 |b), not at least 2 kg (4.4 Ib). The patient should be encouraged to perform 90 to

150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, not 30 minutes of daily exercise. Sodium intake should be limited
to 1500 mg per day.

pp. 358, 359, 360
Question 39

Which long-term dietary modification would be recommended for a patient who has had a
myocardial infarction (MI)? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Cy) | Limit consumption of red meat.

Avoid monounsaturated fats.

Cy) | Limit sodium intake.

Avoid consumption of fish.

@ [BM] Adopt the Mediterranean diet.

That's right!

Rationale

Long-term dietary modifications for patients who have had an MI include limiting consumption of red meat
and sodium intake. The Mediterranean diet, which includes plant-based foods and whole grains, is also
recommended for these patients. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are recommended, instead of
other forms of saturated fat. Consumption of a variety of fish at least twice per week is recommended.

pp. 351, 352
Question 40

Which serving of food is recommended by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

© |B] One to two servings of lean meats, poultry, and fish per day

Two to three servings of low-fat dairy foods per day

Four to six servings of fats and oils per day

@ |B] Four to six servings of fruits per day

™| Four to six servings of vegetables per day

So close!

Rationale

The DASH diet recommends eating two to three servings of low-fat dairy foods, four to six servings of fruits,
and four to six servings of vegetables per day in addition to lean meats, nuts, seeds, dried beans, and high-
fiber grains. The DASH diet recommends three to six servings of lean meats, poultry, and fish per day and two
to three servings of fats and oils per day.

pp. 360-361
Question 41

Which lifestyle modification is recommended to prevent cardiovascular disease? Select all

that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Burn at least as many calories as consumed.

rv) | Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity weekly.

Choose high-fat dairy products most often.

rv) m| Limit dietary sodium intake to 2300 mg per day.

Choose red meat more often than lean meat.

That's right!

Rationale

The recommended lifestyle modifications to prevent cardiovascular disease include aiming for at least 150
minutes of moderate physical activity per week, burning at least as many calories as consumed, and limiting
dietary sodium intake to 2300 mg per day. Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, not high-fat dairy products, are
recommended to be chosen more often. Red meat consumption should be limited, while lean meats are
encouraged.

p. 351
Question 42

Which intervention by the nurse would be appropriate when a patient reports pain, loss of

appetite, and shortness of breath with eating following a myocardial infarction (Ml)?
O Request pain medication.

O Contact the health care provider.

O Suggest that the patient drink some coffee or tea.

rv) © Educate the patient about eating small meals throughout the day.

That's right!

Rationale

Patients who are experiencing a loss of appetite because of pain, medication side effects, or other
complications following an MI may benefit from a brief period of reduced energy intake to reduce the
metabolic workload on the damaged heart. Eating small meals over the course of the day helps decrease the
level of metabolic activity that the weakened heart must perform. Pain medication may be beneficial, but pain
may be reduced by spreading small meals out over the course of the day, and nonpharmacologic measures
should be tried first. Contacting the health care provider would be appropriate, but the nurse can first attempt
to reduce the workload on the heart by spreading the patient’s feedings out over the course of the day.
Suggesting tea or coffee would be inappropriate because patients should avoid caffeine-containing substances

and temperature extremes.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and attainable under ordinary
circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

pp. 352-353
Question 43

Which intervention is priority with a patient with a history of hypertension and

hyperlipidemia who experiences a myocardial infarction (MI)?

rv) © Cardiac rest

O Prescribe a statin
O Lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level

O Educate about the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet

That's right!

Rationale

Immediately following an MI, the health care team would direct all care, including diet, toward ensuring
cardiac rest to promote the return of normal functioning to the damaged heart. Prescribing statins, lowering
the patient’s LDL cholesterol level, and educating the patient about the DASH diet are all important
interventions following an MI, but ensuring cardiac rest is the priority.

congestive heart failure? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Zinc

Sodium

Thiamin

™| Potassium

So close!

Rationale

Thiamin and potassium supplements may be needed to overcome losses from the use of diuretics. Zinc,
sodium, and magnesium are unlikely to be depleted from diuretic use.

p. 355
Question 47

Which is a component of the Mediterranean diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

m| Fresh fruits and vegetables in moderation

m| Chicken, fish, or pork as the main sources of protein

m| Whole grains, nuts, garlic, fish, and wine in moderation

Increased dairy products for healthy teeth and bones

m| Very small amounts of meat and animal products

| Limited dairy products

So close!

Rationale

The Mediterranean diet includes fresh fruits and vegetables in moderation; whole grains, nuts, garlic, fish,
and wine in moderation; meat and animal products in very small amounts; and dairy products used sparingly.
Up to 4% of calories come from fat, mainly olive oil. Chicken, fish, and pork are not the main sources of
protein; they should be consumed in very small amounts. Although dairy products have benefits for healthy
teeth and bones, they are consumed sparingly in the Mediterranean diet.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

Question 48

Which protein is recommended to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Whole grains

m™| Legumes

Whole milk

iv)
rv) m| Dry beans
iv)

Prime cut of beef

| Skinless chicken

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary protein has little effect on low-density lipoproteins, but consuming plant-based proteins appears to be
beneficial. Plant-based proteins include whole grains, legumes, dry beans, nuts, and vegetables. Other good
protein choices include skinless chicken, egg whites, fish, and lean cuts of beef and pork. Low-fat dairy

products and lean meats should be selected rather than whole milk or a prime cut of beef.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 360
Question 49

Which intervention would be appropriate for the nurse to teach a patient who wants to
lower the risk for cardiovascular disease? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Eat fish at least once a week.

Cy) Drinking alcohol in moderation is allowed.

Avoid red meat and poultry consumption.

@ [B] Limit sodium intake to less than 2500 mg per day.

@ |B] Aim for at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week.

So close!

Rationale

The American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular
disease include allowance of moderate intake of alcohol (if at all) and aiming for at least 150 minutes of
physical activity per week. A variety of fish should be consumed at least twice per week. Also included is the
recommendation to avoid red meat; however, skinless poultry is considered a lean meat and can be
consumed. Sodium intake should be limited to 1500 to 2300 mg per day, not 2500 mg per day.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

pp. 350-351
Question 50

Which patient would be at greatest risk for premature cardiovascular mortality?

© An Asian-American patient who has a college education and is physically inactive
@ ©@ A Native American patient who is obese, smokes, and has a high school diploma
© AHispanic patient who is currently in college but is 100% below the poverty level

O An African-American patient who works as an accountant, has moderate alcohol intake, and is
overweight

That's right!

Rationale

The prevalence of premature cardiovascular mortality is significantly higher in certain high-risk populations,
such as Native Americans and South Asian Americans, individuals with low education levels, those with few
socioeconomic resources, and overweight/obese individuals. The Native American patient who is obese,
smokes, and has a high school diploma would be at greatest risk for premature cardiovascular mortality. The
Asian-American patient who is inactive would be at a risk, but having a college degree helps lower that risk.
The Hispanic patient who is 100% below the poverty level would be at risk but is obtaining a higher level of
education, which helps lower the risk. The African-American patient who is overweight would be at risk but has
a college degree and works as an accountant, both of which lower the risk.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices

will seem like the correct response.

pp. 363-364
Question 51

Which response by the nurse would be appropriate when a patient with heart failure who
was given a prescription for a diuretic for a recent diagnosis of hypertension asks about

specific dietary restrictions or foods that should be consumed while taking a diuretic?

© "You should avoid eating nuts because they are high in fat."
© "You should avoid drinking orange juice to prevent toxicity."
@ ©@ "You should eat green, leafy vegetables because they are high in potassium."

© "You will need to drink more water because the diuretic will make you urinate more."

That's right!

Rationale

Diuretics are one of the first-line medications used to lower blood pressure. The continuous use of diuretics
may cause a loss of potassium. The nurse would recommend eating green, leafy vegetables to help maintain a
normal serum potassium level. Nuts would also be recommended for consumption because they are also high
in potassium. Orange juice is another food that contains potassium and should be recommended to the
patient. Informing the patient to drink more fluids would counteract the reason for using a diuretic. Because
this patient has a history of heart failure, they may have fluid restrictions.

p. 359
Question 52

Which dietary recommendation would the nurse recognize as part of the Mediterranean

diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Salt
@ (| Fees
Beef
@ |B) Nuts
@ [| Olive oil
@ |B Red wine

So close!

Rationale

The Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets are appropriate long-term eating
plans for patients with cardiovascular disease who have suffered a myocardial infarction. The Mediterranean
diet includes moderate amounts of dairy products and eggs, nuts, olive oil as the primary source of fat,
moderate intake of red wine with meals, plant-based foods, whole grains, fish and poultry, and fresh fruit as
dessert. The use of herbs and spices should be used instead of salt. Red meat consumption is limited in the

Mediterranean diet.

pp. 351, 352, 353
Question 53

Which discharge instruction would the nurse provide regarding nutrition for a patient
newly diagnosed with atherosclerosis after experiencing a myocardial infarction?

O "You should consume 3 cups of fruits and vegetables per day."
rv) O "You should consume more than 3 cups per day of whole grains."

x) © "You should not consume more than 2000 g of sodium per day."

O "You should not consume more than 48 oz of sugar-sweetened drinks per week."

So close!

Rationale

Atherosclerosis is the underlying pathology of coronary artery disease. Poor diet quality is a risk factor to the
development of atherosclerosis. Recommending that a patient consume more than 3 cups of whole grains a
day would be correct. Patients should consume at least 4.5 cups of fruits and vegetables daily. Patients should
not consume more than 1500 g of sodium per day. Patients should not consume more than 36 oz of sugar-
sweetened beverages per week.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

pp. 350, 351
Question 54

Which intervention would the nurse teach about preventing heart disease when providing
education to a group of patients who have an increased risk for developing cardiovascular

disease (CVD)? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Read food labels.

Use herbs and spices.

Eat complex carbohydrates.

Start prevention activities during adulthood.

Consult with a registered dietitian nutritionist.

So close!

Rationale

Education and disease prevention are important factors for preventing CVD, the primary cause of death in the
United States. An important part of purchasing food is reading food labels. Many seasonings, such as herbs
and spices, can be used to train taste preferences for decreased sodium intake. Complex carbohydrates will
help make healthier main dishes. Different resources and programs are available to the public, including
registered dietitian nutritionists in private practice or health care centers, who can assist with education to

prevent CVD. The prevention of hypertension and heart disease needs to begin during childhood, not during
adulthood.

pp. 362-363
Question 55

Which teaching point would the nurse include when educating the patient about nutrition
modifications and lifestyle modifications to help lower blood pressure? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | "Limit alcohol intake."
Q@ [BM] “Try to limit your stress."
@ |B] “Losing weight is beneficial."
@ |B] "Eat a diet high in potassium."
"Limit your sodium intake to 2500 mg per day.”
I .

That's right!

Rationale

Regardless of hypertensive stage, all patients should receive patient-centered, culturally sensitive guidance on
achieving applicable behavioral and lifestyle modifications. The American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines suggest limiting alcohol intake because moderate alcohol intake is
associated with a reduction of systolic blood pressure by 4 mm Hg. Chronic stress takes a toll on the body and
may lead to elevated blood pressure. Excess weight is closely associated with hypertensive risk factors; the
ACC/AHA guidelines note that weight loss is the most important intervention for treating hypertension. There
is an inverse relationship between potassium intake and blood pressure; a high-potassium intake lowers blood

pressure. The recommended sodium intake for blood pressure control is 1500 to 2300 mg per day.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why," be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal
the correct answer.

pp. 360-361
Question 56

Which goal related to nutrition therapy would the nurse include in discharge instructions
when caring for a patient who had a myocardial infarction (MI)? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

| Promote strength

Lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol

Reduce metabolic workload

Avoid excess effort during eating

Achieve healthy body mass index (BMI) through exercise

That's right!

Rationale

An MI occurs when there is tissue death in the myocardium due to lack of oxygen. Medical nutrition therapy
goals for patients after MI include promoting recovery and strength and providing support in lowering LDL
cholesterol and other known risk factors to prevent additional cardiovascular disease events. Medical nutrition
therapy also involves reducing metabolic workload on the damaged heart by spreading small meals out over
the course of the day. Early feedings may include foods that are relatively soft in texture or easily digested to
avoid excess effort during eating. To lose weight and achieve a healthy BMI, the patient should increase
exercise, so the effort exceeds the number of calories consumed each day.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

So close!

Rationale

The best proven lifestyle interventions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension include consuming
3500 to 5000 mg of potassium per day because there is an inverse association between potassium intake and
blood pressure. Excess weight is closely associated with hypertension risk factors; however, the recommended
weight loss would be 1 kg (2.2 |b), not at least 2 kg (4.4 Ib). The patient should be encouraged to perform 90 to

150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, not 30 minutes of daily exercise. Sodium intake should be limited
to 1500 mg per day.

Which serving of food is recommended by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

One to two servings of lean meats, poultry, and fish per day

rv) | Two to three servings of low-fat dairy foods per day

rv) | Four to six servings of fruits per day

Four to six servings of fats and oils per day

rv) m| Four to six servings of vegetables per day

That's right!

Rationale

The DASH diet recommends eating two to three servings of low-fat dairy foods, four to six servings of fruits,
and four to six servings of vegetables per day in addition to lean meats, nuts, seeds, dried beans, and high-
fiber grains. The DASH diet recommends three to six servings of lean meats, poultry, and fish per day and two

to three servings of fats and oils per day.

pp. 360-361
Question 68

Which high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol value contributes to a decreased risk for heart

disease?
O 60 mg/dL or lower

rv) © 60 mg/dL or higher
O 30 mg/dL to 50 mg/dL

O 15 mg/dL or lower

That's right!

Rationale

Because high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol carries cholesterol from the body’s tissue to the liver for
catabolism, it is referred to as the "good" cholesterol. A value of 60 mg/dL or higher is associated with a
decreased risk for heart disease. Values of 60 mg/dL or lower, 30 mg/dL to 50 mg/dL, and 15 mg/dL or lower

do not decrease the risk for heart disease.

p. 349
Question 69

Which patient would benefit the most from statin therapy?
@ @ A patient with a history of cardiovascular disease

© A patient with a history of hypertension
© A patient with a history of cancer

© A patient with a history of smoking

That's right!

Rationale

The patient who would benefit the most from a statin drug is one with a history of cardiovascular disease.
Statin therapy is not recommended for a person with hypertension, a person with cancer, or a person who
smokes.

p. 352
Question 70

According to the American Heart Association’s dietary guidelines, how often should fish be

consumed as part of a healthy diet?
O Four times per week

O Once daily

rv) O Twice per week
x) © Once per week

So close!

Rationale

According to the American Heart Association’s dietary guidelines, fish should be eaten twice per week. Fish is
low in fat and high in protein, making it a heart-healthy meal option. Eating fish four times per week is

excessive, as is once daily. Once per week is not enough.

p. 349
Question 71

An older patient with heart failure is reviewing menu options and wants to reduce sodium

intake. What is the recommended daily sodium intake?
O 1000 mg/day

rv) © 1500 mg/day
O 2000 mg/day
O 2300 mg/day

That's right!

Rationale

Older adults with heart failure should limit sodium intake to 1500 mg daily. It is alright to consume 1000 mg
of sodium daily, though the patient can have more. Daily consumption of 2000 mg or 2300 mg of sodium is

higher than recommended for this patient.

p. 354
Question 72

Which food helps train taste preferences to adapt to a lowered sodium intake? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Lemon

Grilled chicken

| Onion

Butter

mw] Garlic

iv)

mw] Nonfat milk and yogurt
iv) yog
iv)

That's right!

Rationale

Many seasonings, such as lemon, onion, garlic, nonfat milk and yogurt, wine, fat-free/low-sodium broth,
herbs, and spices, can help to train taste preferences for a lower-sodium diet. Grilled chicken and butter do
not train taste preferences to adapt to a lowered sodium intake.

p. 363
Question 73

Which phrase describes a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood
pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg?

rv) © Stage 1 hypertension
O Stage 2 hypertension

O Elevated blood pressure

O Normal blood pressure

That's right!

Rationale

Stage 1 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood
pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension is classified as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or
greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater. Elevated blood pressure, also known as
prehypertension, is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 129 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure
of less than 80 mm Hg. Normal blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm

Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

p. 358
Question 74

Which description of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet eating plan
would the nurse provide to a patient who was recently diagnosed with stage 2

hypertension?
Cy) © Eat lean meats, beans, and nuts.

© Eat low-fiber grains and low-sodium foods.
© Eat four servings of low-fat dairy foods per day.

© Eat three servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables per day.

That's right!

Rationale

The DASH diet is the result of the DASH landmark study, in which blood pressure was significantly lowered by
diet alone over 2 weeks. The DASH diet recommends eating lean meats, beans, and nuts. The diet
recommends eating high-fiber, not low-fiber, foods and low-sodium foods. It also recommends eating two to
three servings of low-fat dairy foods per day, not four servings. Further, the diet recommends eating four to

six servings of fruits and four to six servings of vegetables per day, not three servings.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

pp. 360-361
Question 75

Which patient has the highest risk for atherosclerosis?
© A 60-year-old Caucasian man with high levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol

@ @ A 55-year-old postmenopausal African American woman
© A 40-year-old man with poor diet quality and high levels of inflammatory markers

© A35-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 and a history of cigarette smoking

That's right!

Rationale

The 55-year-old postmenopausal African American woman has the highest risk for atherosclerosis. Her age
and race put her at a higher risk than the others. Although men have a greater risk of developing
atherosclerosis than do women, the relative risks are similar for both sexes after women reach menopause.
High levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol are protective against atherosclerosis. Poor diet quality,
high levels of inflammatory markers, high BMI, and cigarette smoking are modifiable risk factors that could
impact risk, particularly for men and women in their 30s and early 40s.

p. 348
Question 76

The nurse is reviewing the medical record of a patient admitted to the hospital with
cardiovascular disease. Which statement made by the patient is the nurse’s highest priority

for addressing?
© "My cholesterol level last week was 199 mg/dL."

© "My body mass index (BMI) is 19.0 kg/m a
@ @ "My father died of a heart attack."
© "My mother has diabetes and high blood pressure."

That's right!

Rationale

There is a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease. The patient’s father (a first-degree relative)
died of a coronary event, increasing the patient’s risk for a heart attack. A total cholesterol level of less than
200 mg/dL is considered optimal. A BMI of 19.0 kg/m 2 is normal. The fact that the patient’s mother has
diabetes and high blood pressure increases the patient’s risk for those illnesses, but they are of a less-

immediate concern in this scenario.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 348
Question 77

A patient with a history of atherosclerosis is admitted to the coronary care unit after
myocardial infarction. Which diet order does the nurse anticipate for this patient?
rv) © Liquid diet as tolerated

O Low-sodium diet
O Low-fat, high-protein diet

O Meals supplemented with Ensure

That's right!

Rationale

The focus of a patient with myocardial infarction is to reduce the workload of the heart. As such, the patient is
placed on liquids and may progress food consistency as tolerated. A low-sodium diet is recommended for
patients with hypertension. Low-fat, high-protein diets are optimal for patients recovering from surgery or

those with depleted energy stores. Supplementing meals with Ensure is usually recommended for patients
with poor oral intake.

Question 1

Which food sources supply carbohydrates in the form of naturally occurring sugars?

© Cakes and cookies
@ ©@ Fruit and dairy products
© Whole grains and cereals

© Legumes and rice

That's right!

Rationale
Fruit and dairy products are sources of naturally occurring sugars, including fructose and lactose. Cakes and

cookies contain added sugars, not naturally occurring sugars. Whole grains and cereals, as well as legumes
and rice, contain complex carbohydrates such as dietary fiber and are not sources of naturally occurring

sugars.

pp. 13-14
Question 2

Which statement about carbohydrate absorption is true?

© Chemical digestion of carbohydrates is completed in the large intestine.
© Stomach acid and enzymes increase amylase action for carbohydrate absorption.
©) Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the large intestine.

@ ©@ Carbohydrates must be broken down into monosaccharides before they can be absorbed into
circulation.

That's right!

Rationale

Carbohydrates must be broken down into monosaccharides before they can be absorbed into circulation.
Chemical digestion of carbohydrates is completed in the small intestine. Stomach acid and enzymes halt
amylase action. Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth and progresses through the gastrointestinal
tract.

p. 13
Question 3

What is the dietary reference intake (DRI) per day for carbohydrates for adults?

© 75 to 125g
© 150 to 200 g

@ @ 225 to 325¢

© 350 to 450 g

That's right!

Rationale

The DRIs recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake come from carbohydrate foods; this translates to
225 to 325 g of carbohydrates for a 2000 kcal/day diet. Further, 75 to 125 g and 150 to 200 g are too low, and
350 to 450 g of carbohydrates is too high.

p. 24
Question 4

Which food choice provides complex carbohydrates?

O Milk

That's right!

Rationale

Polysaccharides, including starch and certain fibers, are complex carbohydrates. Beans are an example of a
food containing complex carbohydrates. Milk and carrots contain disaccharides, which are classified as simple
carbohydrates. Peaches and other fruits contain monosaccharides, which are also considered simple
carbohydrates.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; however, every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p. 13
Question 5

Which statement would most accurately describe complex carbohydrates?

@ @ "Complex carbohydrates may provide fiber in addition to glucose."
© "Complex carbohydrates are not digestible by the body and pass through undigested."
© "Complex carbohydrates include all carbohydrates composed of more than one sugar unit."

© "Complex carbohydrates circulate freely in the blood and are the main source of energy for the brain."

That's right!

Rationale

Complex carbohydrates may provide fiber in addition to glucose. Although some complex carbohydrates,
such as fiber, are not digestible, others are digested and broken down into glucose. Disaccharides are
composed of two single-sugar units but are considered simple carbohydrates. Simple, not complex,
carbohydrates circulate freely in the blood and are the main source of energy for the brain.

p.15
Question 6

Which statement best describes the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates?

@ @ The only real nutrient function of carbohydrates is the supply of energy.
© Natural carbohydrate sweeteners are accompanied by essential nutrients.
© The sweeteners provided by carbohydrates help regulate blood glucose levels.

© Carbohydrates provide dietary fiber, which is crucial for effective bodily functions.

That's right!

Rationale

Although carbohydrates provide energy, fiber, and sweeteners, the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates
is the supply of energy. Carbohydrate sweeteners found naturally in some foods are accompanied by essential
nutrients; however, this does not describe the only real nutrient function of carbohydrates. Sweeteners
provided by carbohydrates do affect blood glucose levels; however, this statement does not clearly describe the
only real nutrient function of carbohydrates. Dietary fiber is used by the body for several purposes; however,
the provision of dietary fiber is not the real nutrient function of carbohydrates.

p.12
Question 7

Lactose, or milk sugar, is classified as which type of carbohydrate?

iv) © Disaccharide

©) Polysaccharide
©) Oligosaccharide
© Monosaccharide

That's right!

Rationale

Lactose is composed of glucose and galactose and is considered a disaccharide. Lactose is not considered an
oligosaccharide or polysaccharide, because it only contains two sugar units. Lactose is not considered a

monosaccharide, because it has more than one sugar unit.

p.14
Question 8

Which food is a preferred energy source of body cells? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.
@ |B Rice
@ |) Pasta
© [ml] Apples
@ [| White bread
|_| Broccoli

So close!

Rationale

The preferred energy source of the body cells is starch, because starch yields glucose; rice, pasta, and white
bread, which are high in starch, are appropriate choices. Vegetables and fruits supply carbohydrates in the

form of naturally occurring sugars, which are not preferred energy sources.

p. 13
Question 8

Which food is a preferred energy source of body cells? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.
@ |B Rice
@ |) Pasta
© [ml] Apples
@ [| White bread
|_| Broccoli

So close!

Rationale

The preferred energy source of the body cells is starch, because starch yields glucose; rice, pasta, and white
bread, which are high in starch, are appropriate choices. Vegetables and fruits supply carbohydrates in the

form of naturally occurring sugars, which are not preferred energy sources.

p. 13
Question 9

Which statement concerning food sources of complex carbohydrates requires correction?

© "Corn, peas, and oatmeal are all good sources of complex carbohydrates."
©) "Baked potatoes are a good source of complex carbohydrates as long as the skin is eaten as well."
© "Hamburger buns and whole-wheat bread can be good sources of complex carbohydrates."

@ @ "Wo easily obtained sources of complex carbohydrates are sugar beets and corn syrup."

That's right!

Rationale

Sugar beets and corn syrup are sources of simple carbohydrates, not complex carbohydrates. Corn, peas, and
oatmeal are all good sources of complex carbohydrates. Potatoes are a good source of complex carbohydrates
if the skin is eaten as well, because the skin contains a greater concentration of dietary fiber. Hamburger buns

and whole-wheat bread are both good sources of complex carbohydrates.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid taking a wild guess at an answer. However, should you feel insecure about a question,
eliminate the alternatives that you believe are definitely incorrect, and reread the information given to make
sure you understand the intent of the question. This approach increases your chances of randomly selecting

the correct answer or getting a clearer understanding of what is being asked.

p. 13
Question 10

Which food source contributes to an increased incidence of dental caries and should be

minimized or avoided in the diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [B) Fruit drinks
@ [BB] Sports drinks

[|] Whole fruits
|_| Whole-grain breads
@ [_| Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals

So close!

Rationale

Fruit drinks, sports drinks, and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are highly processed or contain added sugars
that contribute to dental caries; thus these foods should be minimized or avoided in the diet. Whole fruits
have naturally occurring sugars that pose less of a risk to the teeth. Whole-grain breads can help prevent
dental caries, because unprocessed starch cannot pass through the dental plaque to attack the enamel.

p. 21
Question 10

Which food source contributes to an increased incidence of dental caries and should be

minimized or avoided in the diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [B) Fruit drinks
@ [BB] Sports drinks

[|] Whole fruits
|_| Whole-grain breads
@ [_| Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals

Rationale

Fruit drinks, sports drinks, and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are highly processed or contain added sugars
that contribute to dental caries; thus these foods should be minimized or avoided in the diet. Whole fruits
have naturally occurring sugars that pose less of a risk to the teeth. Whole-grain breads can help prevent
dental caries, because unprocessed starch cannot pass through the dental plaque to attack the enamel.

p. 21
Question 11

Which strategy will help decrease the amount of added sugar in the diet? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

|_| Replace soft drinks with fruit drinks.
@ |B] Read food labels to avoid foods with added sugars.
@ [BB] Use fruit canned in water or natural juice rather than syrup.
@ [BB] Use fresh fruit instead of syrup on pancakes and waffles.

@ [BB] Use fruit purees instead of sugar as sweeteners in cakes.

That's right!

Rationale

Reading food labels to avoid those with added sugars, using fruits canned in water or natural juice rather than
syrup, using fresh fruit instead of syrup on pancakes and waffles, and using fruit purees as sweeteners instead
of sugar in cakes can all help decrease the amount of added sugar in the diet. Replacing soft drinks with fruit
drinks will not decrease added sugar in the diet because most fruit drinks contain added sugars.

p.14
Question 12

The body can digest and metabolize carbohydrates to produce which substance for energy?
O Amino acids

iv) © Glucose

O Essential nutrients

O Protein

That's right!

Rationale

The body can digest and metabolize carbohydrates to produce glucose for energy. Glucose is the basic single
sugar in human metabolism and is the primary fuel source for cells. Amino acids are the building blocks of
protein that are necessary for constructing and repairing body tissues. Essential nutrients are substances that
a person must obtain from food because the body cannot make them in sufficient quantity to meet
physiologic needs. The primary function of protein is tissue building, and amino acids are the building blocks
of protein.

p.12
Question 13

Which food is a good source of pectin and can help in reducing the total cholesterol level?

iv) © Oranges

O Popcorn
© Flaxseed

O Bran cereal

That's right!

Rationale

Oranges are a source of pectin, which binds bile acid and thus reduces serum cholesterol levels. Popcorn and
flaxseed are sources of cellulose and mucilage, respectively, and do not play a role in cholesterol reduction.
Bran cereal will bind bile acid and help reduce serum cholesterol levels, but it is a source of hemicellulose, not

pectin.

p.17
Question 13

Which food is a good source of pectin and can help in reducing the total cholesterol level?

iv) © Oranges

O Popcorn
© Flaxseed

O Bran cereal

That's right!

Rationale

Oranges are a source of pectin, which binds bile acid and thus reduces serum cholesterol levels. Popcorn and
flaxseed are sources of cellulose and mucilage, respectively, and do not play a role in cholesterol reduction.
Bran cereal will bind bile acid and help reduce serum cholesterol levels, but it is a source of hemicellulose, not

pectin.

p.17
Question 14

A client who reports consuming large amounts of milk, cheese, and ice cream reports
bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Which condition would be associated with
these symptoms?

© Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
O Crohn’s disease
O Diverticulitis

ivy) © Lactose intolerance

That's right!

Rationale

Bloating, gas pain, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea following ingestion of lactose-containing foods (e.g.,
milk, cheese, or ice cream) suggest lactose intolerance. IBS may produce similar symptoms; however, there is
no relationship between IBS symptoms and lactose-containing foods. Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) in which the lining of the digestive tract becomes inflamed, producing pain, severe
diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. Crohn’s symptoms are not exclusive to ingestion of lactose-

containing foods, nor are diverticulitis symptoms.

p. 23
Question 15

Which nutritional teaching point about carbohydrates is accurate? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.
@ [BB] Half of the daily intake of grains should be whole grains.

|_| Replace whole grains with refined grains for breakfast and lunch.
@ |B] Add dark green, red, and orange vegetables to main and side dishes.
|_| Eat at least 2.5 c of vegetables per day; only fresh vegetables count.
iv) [ml] Select fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruit more often than fruit juice.

@ |B] Beans and peas are great sources of fiber.

That's right!

Rationale

Healthy dietary intake of carbohydrates includes fruits, vegetables, and grains. Whole grains should constitute
at least half of all grains consumed during the day. Clients should add dark green, red, and orange vegetables
to main and side dishes to increase nutrient benefits. Fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruits should be
consumed more often than fruit juice. Beans and peas are great sources of fiber. Whole grains are preferable
to refined grains. Clients should eat at least 2.5 c of vegetables per day, but frozen, fresh, and canned

vegetables all count toward the daily intake goal.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 25
Question 16

The parotid glands secrete an enzyme that acts on starch to begin its breakdown into
dextrins and disaccharides. What is this enzyme called?

©) Glucose

O Hydrochloric acid
@ © Pryalin

© Saliva

That's right!

Rationale

Ptyalin (also called salivary amylase) is the enzyme released during mastication by the parotid glands. It acts on
starch to begin its breakdown into dextrins and disaccharides. Glucose is a simple sugar derived from
carbohydrates. Hydrochloric acid is a gastric secretion that changes pepsinogen to pepsin. Saliva is a watery
liquid secreted by the mouth that provides lubrication for chewing and swallowing.

p. 23
Question 17

Which finding indicates that carbohydrate levels are sufficient to meet the body’s energy
demands?

© Elevated serum glucose level
© Elevated serum potassium level

ivy) © Normal serum ketone level

O Decreased sodium chloride level

That's right!

Rationale

A normal serum ketone level indicates that fats are not being used to supply energy. This results when
carbohydrate levels are sufficient for meeting the body’s energy demands. Persistent elevated serum glucose
levels, also called hyperglycemia, is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus. Elevated serum potassium may occur due
to renal disease or renal failure. Decreased sodium chloride levels often indicate overhydration or fluid volume

€XCEeSs.

p. 22
Question 18

Where does carbohydrate digestion begin?
© Esophagus
© Small intestine
©) Stomach

ivy) © Mouth

That's right!

Rationale

The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth and progresses through the gastrointestinal tract. Food
broken down into small particles in the mouth passes into the esophagus, stomach, and eventually to the

small intestine for absorption.

p. 22
Question 19

In which form are carbohydrates stored in the body for times when a quick source of energy

is needed?

O Glucose

©) Gluconeogenesis

@ @ Glycogen

© Glycogenesis

That's right!

Rationale

Glycogen is the form in which carbohydrates are stored in the body and are used when a quick source of
energy is needed. Glucose is a simple sugar derived from carbohydrates. Gluconeogenesis is a term
describing conversion of noncarbohydrate substances into glucose. Glycogenesis describes the process of

combining units of glucose to store as glycogen.

p. 13
Question 20

Which term represents the actual breakdown of substances resulting from the production
and/or storage of gastric and digestive secretions?

© Mechanical digestion

© Nutrient absorption

@ @ Chemical digestion
© Metabolism

That's right!

Rationale

Chemical digestion is the actual breakdown of substances resulting from the production and/or storage of
gastric and digestive secretions. Mechanical digestion comprises chewing, peristalsis, segmentation, and the
action of sphincter muscles, which regulate the movement of food from one organ to the next. Nutrient
absorption occurs as digested molecules of food, water, and minerals from the diet are taken up for the body’s
use and occurs mainly in the small intestine. Metabolism is a set of processes through which absorbed
nutrients are used by the body for energy to form and maintain body structures and functions.

p. 23
Question 21

Which class of carbohydrates is considered the building blocks of all carbohydrates?
©) Disaccharides

©) Polysaccharides
©) Oligosaccharides
@ @ Monosaccharides

That's right!

Rationale

Monosaccharides are the basic building blocks of all carbohydrates and require no digestion. Disaccharides
are composed of two single-sugar units linked together and are not considered the building blocks of all
carbohydrates. Polysaccharides and oligosaccharides are complex carbohydrates composed of many sugar

units and are not considered the building blocks of all carbohydrates.

p. 13
Question 22

Which statement about saliva is accurate?

© Saliva contains secretin, which helps break down bicarbonate.
O Saliva contains intrinsic factor, which facilitates absorption of vitamin B 1.
@ ©@ Saliva contains amylase, an enzyme that begins the process of digesting starches.

© Saliva contains cholecystokinin (CCK), which stimulates the gallbladder to release bile.

That's right!

Rationale

Saliva contains amylase, an enzyme that begins the process of digesting starches. Secretin is a hormone
released by the small intestine to help control acidic content of chyme. The lining of the stomach releases
intrinsic factor, which is necessary for absorption of vitamin B 12. CCK is a hormone secreted by intestinal
mucosa that stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.

p. 23
Question 23

Which statement about the glycemic index (Gl) is incorrect?

@ O "lt is the same for every person."
© "It varies with how much food | eat."
© "It varies depending on the time of day | eat."

© ©@ "It depends on the ripeness of fruits and vegetables and the method used to cook them."

So close!

Rationale

GI can be problematic because there is a wide range of variability. It is not the same for every person. GI varies
related to how much food is eaten as well as the time of day it is eaten. Gl also depends on the ripeness of
fruits and vegetables as well as the variety and cooking method used.

p. 22
Question 24
|

A patient following a 1300-kcal diet has consumed 220 kcal in carbohydrates for breakfast.
Using this information, calculate the minimum and maximum number of grams of
carbohydrates available for the rest of the day. Round to the nearest whole number. Enter

both values separated by a comma and no additional spaces.

03555 | @/ m8 |e

So close!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake comes from carbohydrates.
The total caloric intake is 1300 kcal. The minimum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrates is 585 (0.45
multiplied by 1300), and the maximum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrates is 845 (0.65 multiplied by
1300). Each gram of carbohydrate has 4 kcal; therefore divide the recommended range of kilocalories from
carbohydrates (as determined previously) by 4. The minimum number of grams of carbohydrates the patient
needs is 146 g (585 divided by 4); the maximum number of grams of carbohydrates is 211.25 (845 divided by
4). The patient has consumed 220 kcal (55 g) of carbohydrates for breakfast. The minimum and maximum
grams of carbohydrates available for the rest of the day is 91 and 156 g, respectively.

Test-Taking Tip: When taking the NCLEX exam, an on-screen calculator will be available for you to determine

your response, which you will then type in the provided space.

pp. 25-26
Question 25

A patient following a 1950-kcal diet has 150 kcal from carbohydrates planned for breakfast
and 400 kcal from carbohydrates planned for lunch. Calculate the max number of

kilocalories from carbohydrates the patient can consume for the rest of the day. Round to

the nearest whole number. rv) kcal

That's right!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake comes from carbohydrates.
The total energy intake is 1950 kcal. The maximum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrate is 0.65 multiplied
by 1950, giving 1267.5 kcal. If the patient plans to consume meals containing 150 kcal from carbohydrates for
lunch and 400 kcal from carbohydrates for dinner, add the two amounts together to calculate how many
grams of kcal of carbohydrates consumed so far (150 + 400 kcal = 550 kcal). Therefore the maximum
kilocalories from carbohydrates available for the rest of the meals will be 1267.5 - 550 = 717.5 (718 kcal after
rounding).

pp. 25-26
Question 26

Which statement describes possible outcomes of insufficient dietary carbohydrate intake?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[|_| "Osmotic diarrhea may occur."
|_| "Mineral absorption will be greatly reduced."
@ [BB] "Fat is broken down to use for energy, resulting in the production of ketones."
@ [BB] “The required minute-to-minute supply of glucose for the brain may not be available."

@ [BB] "Protein is sacrificed to supply energy, which affects tissue growth and maintenance."

That's right!

Rationale

Carbohydrates help regulate protein and fat metabolism. If carbohydrates are not available, protein and fat are
metabolized for energy instead. Protein is necessary for tissue growth and maintenance, a function that
cannot be served by other macronutrients. Rapid fat metabolism produces ketones, which upset the normal
acid-base balance of the body. The brain does not store supplies of glucose and is dependent on constant
carbohydrate intake; thus, an inadequate supply can lead to brain damage. Osmotic diarrhea is the result of
excessive intake of carbohydrates such as sugar alcohols, not the result of inadequate carbohydrate intake.
Mineral absorption is reduced when carbohydrates such as dietary fiber are excessive, not with inadequate

dietary intake of carbohydrates.

Question 27

A patient following a 1400-kcal diet should be getting 630 to 910 kcal per day from
carbohydrates. Using this information, calculate the maximum number of grams of

carbohydrates the patient needs. Round answer to the nearest whole number.

of ls

That's right!

Rationale

The maximum recommended number of grams of carbohydrates needed is 228.There are multiple steps in
determining the recommended intake for carbohydrates. First, total energy intake must be considered, which
includes accounting for each item consumed throughout the day. This number is then multiplied by 45% and
65% to determine the recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrates. In this case, the total energy
intake was 1400 kcal. Multiplying 1400 by 0.45 and 0.65 yielded the recommended range of 630 to 910 kcal
from carbohydrates per day. Because each gram of carbohydrate has 4 kcal, the recommended range of
kilocalories from carbohydrate must be divided by 4; 630 divided by 4 is 157.5, and 910 divided by 4 is 227.5

(228 when rounded).

Question 28

Which problem is associated with the "net carb" theory? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

|_| Sugar alcohols do not have kilocalories.
@ [By It is a marketing tactic of food manufacturers.
@ |B] Excessive intake of sugar alcohols can cause diarrhea.
|_| The safety of excessive use of sugar alcohols in foods is well established.

@ [_| Sugar alcohols and fiber have low glycemic index values.

So close!

Rationale

" Net carbs" is a term invented by food manufacturers as a marketing tactic to cater to the low-carbohydrate
diet craze. Excess intake of sugar alcohols can cause diarrhea. Food manufacturers reasoned that they could
simply subtract these carbohydrates from the total carbohydrates in a food serving because dietary fiber and
sugar alcohols have lower glycemic index values. Sugar alcohols do have kilocalories and can raise blood sugar
levels. The safety of excessive use of sugar alcohols in foods is not known, but this type of labeling encourages
manufacturers to increase the use of products such as sorbitol to further their "net carb" claim.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked

Question 29

If a patient is following a 1650-kcal diet and needs 743 to 1073 kcal per day from

carbohydrates, which minimum number of grams of carbohydrates does the patient

need? Round answer to the nearest whole number. @ g

That's right!

Rationale

There are multiple steps in determining the recommended intake for carbohydrates. First, total energy intake
must be considered which includes accounting for each item consumed throughout the day. This number is
then multiplied by 45% and 65% to determine the recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrates.
In this case, the 1650 kcal were the total energy intake. Multiplying 1650 by 0.45 and 0.65 yielded the
recommended range of 743-1073 kilocalories from carbohydrates per day, when rounded off. Because each
gram of carbohydrate has 4 kcal, the recommended range of kilocalories from carbohydrates must be divided
by 4. In this case, 743 divided by 4 is 185.75, and 1073 divided by 4 is 268.25. Therefore the minimum

recommended number of grams of carbohydrates needed is 186.

pp. 25-26
Question 30

A patient consumes 45 g of carbohydrates for breakfast as part of a 1600-kcal diet. Using
this information, calculate the minimum number of kilocalories from carbohydrates

available for the rest of the patient’s meals for the day. Round to the nearest whole

number. @| 540 | kcal

That's right!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake comes from carbohydrates.
The total energy intake is 1600 kcal. The minimum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrates is 0.45 multiplied
by 1600, yielding 720 kcal. Each gram of carbohydrate has 4 kcal. The patient consumed 45 kilocalories from
carbohydrates during breakfast, and 45 multiplied by 4 equals 180 kcal. The minimum number of kilocalories
from carbohydrates available for the rest of the day is 540 kcal (720 minus 180).

pp. 25-26
Question 31

A patient is following a 1700-kcal diet and has 150 kcal from carbohydrates for dinner.

Calculate the maximum number of grams of carbohydrates available for the rest of the day.

Round to the nearest whole number. @ g

That's right!

Rationale

There are multiple steps in determining the recommended intake for carbohydrates. First, total energy intake
must be considered, which includes accounting for each item consumed throughout the day. This number is
then multiplied by 65% to determine the recommended maximum number of kilocalories from
carbohydrates. In this case, 1700 kcal is the total energy intake. Multiplying 1700 by 0.65 yields the maximum
amount of 1105 kilocalories from carbohydrates per day. A total of 150 kilocalories will be used for dinner. The
maximum number of kilocalories remaining for the day is 955 kcal (1105 minus 150). Because each gram of
carbohydrate has 4 kcal, the recommended range of kilocalories from carbohydrates must be divided by 4.

Therefore the maximum recommended number of grams of carbohydrates needed for the rest of the day is
239 when rounded (955 divided by 4).

pp. 25-26
Question 32

A patient is accustomed to eating 60 g of carbohydrates for lunch and is following a 2000-

kcal diet. Calculate the maximum number of grams of carbohydrates available for the rest

of the day. Round to the nearest whole number. @ 265 | g

That's right!

Rationale

There are multiple steps in determining the recommended intake for carbohydrates. First, total energy intake
must be considered, which includes accounting for each item consumed throughout the day. This number is
then multiplied by 65% to determine the recommended maximum number of kilocalories from
carbohydrates. In this case, the 2000 kcal is the total energy intake. Multiplying 2000 by 0.65 yields the
maximum amount of 1300 kcal from carbohydrates per day. Because each gram of carbohydrate has 4 kcal,
the recommended range of kilocalories from carbohydrates must then be divided by 4. The maximum
recommended number of grams of carbohydrates is 325 (1300 divided by 4). If 60 g of carbohydrate is
consumed for lunch, the maximum number of grams of carbohydrates available for the rest of the day is 265
(325 minus 60).

pp. 25-26
Question 33

A patient following a 1600-kcal diet consumes 300 kcal of carbohydrates during breakfast.

Calculate the maximum number of kilocalories from carbohydrates available for the rest of

the day. Round to the nearest whole number. @ kcal

That's right!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake comes from carbohydrates.
In this case, the total caloric intake is 1600 kcal. The maximum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrates is
calculated by multiplying 0.65 by 1600, which is 1040 kcal. If 300 kcal of carbohydrates is used for the first
meal, a maximum of 740 kcal from carbohydrates (1040 minus 300) is available for the rest of the day.

Question 34

A patient requires 2100 kcal per day. Calculate the minimum number of kilocalories of

carbohydrates that would be available for the rest of the day if lunch contains 285 kcal of

carbohydrates. Round to the nearest whole number. @| co | kcal

That's right!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that 45%-65% of total caloric intake comes from carbohydrates. In
this case, the total caloric intake is 2100 kcal. The minimum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrates is 945
(0.45 multiplied by 2100). If 285 kcal of carbohydrates is consumed for lunch, the minimum number of
kilocalories from carbohydrates available for the rest of the day is 660 (945 minus 285).

pp. 25-26
Question 35

A patient following a 1200-kcal diet should be getting 540 to 780 kcal from carbohydrates

daily. Calculate the minimum number of grams of carbohydrates the patient needs. Round

answer to the nearest whole number. @ g

That's right!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake comes from carbohydrates.
The total caloric intake is 1200 kcal. The minimum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrates is 540 (0.45
multiplied by 1200). Each gram of carbohydrate has 4 kcal; therefore divide 540 by 4. The minimum number
of grams of carbohydrates needed by the patient is 135.

pp. 25-26
Question 36

A patient is following a 2100-kcal diet. Their breakfast has 325 kcal of carbohydrates.

Calculate the minimum number of grams of carbohydrates required for the rest of the day.

Round to the nearest whole number. @ g

That's right!

Rationale

There are multiple steps in determining the recommended intake for carbohydrates. First, total energy intake
must be considered, which includes accounting for each item consumed throughout the day. This number is
then multiplied by 45% to determine the recommended minimum number of kilocalories from
carbohydrates. In this case, 2100 kcal is the total energy intake. Multiplying 2100 by 0.45 yields the minimum
amount of 945 kilocalories from carbohydrates per day. The patient consumed 325 kcal of carbohydrates for
breakfast. The minimum number of kilocalories remaining for the day is 620 kcal. Because each gram of
carbohydrate has 4 kcal, the recommended range of kilocalories from carbohydrates must be divided by 4.
Therefore the minimum recommended number of grams of carbohydrates needed for the rest of the day is
155 (620 divided by 4).

Question 37

Calculate the maximum number of kilocalories of carbohydrates a patient can eat for the

rest of the day after eating 55 g of carbohydrates for lunch with a maximum daily intake of

1500 kcal. Round answer to the nearest whole number. @| 1280 rv) kcal

So close!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake comes from carbohydrates.
The total energy intake is 1500 kcal. Maximum allowed kilocalories from carbohydrate is 0.65 multiplied by
1500, yielding 975 kcal. Each gram of carbohydrate has 4 kcal; therefore multiply the kilocalories used for
lunch by 4 (55 x 4 = 220 kcal). The patient has consumed 220 kcal for lunch. The maximum kilocalories of

carbohydrates available for the rest of the day can be obtained by subtracting 220 from 975, which equals 755
kcal.

Question 38

A patient is on an 1800-kcal diet. Calculate the minimum recommended number of

kilocalories from carbohydrates for this patient. Round answer to the nearest whole

number. @\s10 | kcal

That's right!

Rationale

The Dietary Reference Intakes recommend that carbohydrates account for 45% to 65% of total caloric intake.
To calculate the recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrates for a patient, the total energy intake
must be multiplied by 45% and 65% to determine the recommended range. In this case, the 1800 kcal is the
total energy intake and when multiplied by 45% and 65%, a range of 810 to 1170 kcal is calculated. Therefore
the minimum recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrate is 810.

pp. 25-26
Question 39

Which statement about hypolactasia is correct? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

|_| "Lactase is secreted by the pancreas into the small intestine."
@ [BB] “Lactase is abundantly secreted in the neonatal period."
@ [B) "Hypolactasia does not present side effects until less than 50% of the enzyme is active."
© |B] "Lactase production decreases by 7 years of age."

|_| "Lactase deficiency in humans is uncommon."

So close!

Rationale

Lactase is present in abundance in infancy, and production decreases after infancy. Lactase is absent or
deficient from the brush border cells of the small intestine in a condition known as hypolactasia, which
usually does not present side effects until less than 50% of the enzyme is active. Lactase is secreted from the
brush border (i.e., microvilli) of the intestinal tract along with sucrase and maltase. The production of lactase
decreases considerably by 4 years of age. Lactase deficiency after infancy affects approximately 65% of people
worldwide, with a much higher prevalence in certain countries and ethnic groups.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 25
Question 40

Which of the following statements describes the features of carbohydrates? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

|_| Molasses contains fructose.
@ [| Maltose and galactose are not found as such in food form.
[| Cow’s milk contains 7% lactose.
@ |B] Unused glucose is stored in the body as glycogen.
© [BB] Starch consists of branched amylose and branched amylopectin.

tx} [ml] Potatoes contain more starch than wheat.

So close!

Rationale

Galactose does not usually exist as a free monosaccharide in the diet; rather, it is a product of lactose (milk
sugar) digestion. Maltose is an intermediate product of starch digestion. Depending on the immediate energy
demands, the body will use monosaccharides like glucose for energy or store them as glycogen for later use.
Molasses, a by-product of sugar production, is also a form of sucrose. Cow’s milk contains approximately
4.8% lactose; human milk contains approximately 7% lactose. Starch consists of unbranched amylose and
branched amylopectin. Potatoes have 15% starch, while wheat has 55% starch.

pp. 13, 15
Question 41

Which of the following foods is a source of soluble fiber?

O Bran

© Whole grains

O Broccoli
ivy) © Legumes

That's right!

Rationale

Legumes are a source of soluble fiber. Bran, whole grains, and broccoli are all examples of insoluble fiber.

p.17
Question 42

When menu planning for a patient with diabetes, for which reason would the nurse include
carbohydrates in the diet? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Asa basic fuel supply for the body
|_| To provide calcium to the body
@ [BB] To regulate fat metabolism
@ [BB] To regulate protein metabolism
@ [BB] As a way to introduce glucose into the body

That's right!

Rationale

The main function of carbohydrates is to provide fuel for the body. Carbohydrates help to regulate protein and
fat metabolism. If dietary carbohydrate intake meets the body’s energy needs, protein will not be sacrificed for
fuel. The body converts most carbohydrates in food into glucose to provide energy for the body.
Carbohydrates are not calcium rich.

pp. 21-22
Question 43

Which characteristic is associated with nonnutritive sweeteners? Select all that apply.One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

© Slow digestion

iv) © No caloric value

O Contain sorbitol
O Less sweet than sucrose

O Lowered risk for dental caries

That's right!

Rationale

Nonnutritive sweeteners have no caloric value. Nutritive sweeteners, not nonnutritive, utilize sugar alcohol
that slows digestion. The most common sugar alcohol is sorbitol. Nutritive sweeteners are much sweeter than
sucrose; therefore the same sweet taste comes from extremely small quantities of the product. Nutritive
sweeteners also provide a lower risk for dental caries.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,
read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 19
Question 44

Which aspect of carbohydrate digestion is facilitated by the liver?

© Secretion of amylase to begin chemical digestion
©) Production of acid and enzymes that halt the amylase action
© Collection of additional amylase to continue the breakdown of simple carbohydrates

@ ©@ Regulation of glucose entering the blood in response to pancreatic hormones

That's right!

Rationale

The liver regulates the amount of glucose entering the blood in response to pancreatic hormones. The mouth
begins mechanical digestion of carbohydrates by breaking food into smaller pieces and secreting amylase into
the saliva to start the process of chemical digestion. The stomach produces acid and enzymes that halt the
amylase action. The small intestine secretes intestinal enzymes and collects pancreatic amylase, which

continues the breakdown of simple carbohydrates.

p. 24
Question 45

Which type of fiber is insoluble and helps the digestive tract hold water? Select all apply.

One, some, or all responses are correct.

Select all that apply

iv) [ml] Lignin

iv) [ml] Cellulose
iv) [ml] Hemicellulose

That's right!

Rationale
Lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose are insoluble fibers that hold water. Gums and pectin are soluble fibers
that are used to thicken and bind foods together.

p.17
Question 46

The consumption of which of the following could be increased to include more complex
carbohydrates in the diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

[| Cow’s milk

iv) [ml] Legumes

[| Molasses

iv) [ml] Potatoes
iv) [ml] Rice
@ [B) Whole grains

That's right!

Rationale

Complex carbohydrates consist of polysaccharides, which are composed of many sugar units. These include
starch, glycogen, and dietary fiber. Major food sources of starch include grains such as cereals, pastas, breads,
and crackers. Starch is also found in legumes such as beans or peas and in potatoes and rice. Glycogen is
typically found in grains as well as some fruits and vegetables. Simple carbohydrates include monosaccharides

and disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose, which can be found in molasses and cow’s milk.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 13
Question 47

A patient is consuming approximately 1650 calories kcal per day. Calculate the maximum

recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrates for this patient. Round answer to

the nearest whole number. @| 1073 kcal

That's right!

Rationale

The maximum recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrates is 1073 kcal. The Dietary Reference
Intakes recommend that carbohydrates account for 45% to 65% of total caloric intake. To calculate the
recommended number of kilocalories from carbohydrates for a patient, the total energy intake must be
multiplied by 45% and 65% to determine the recommended range. In this case, 1650 kcal is the total energy
intake and when multiplied by 45% and 65%, a range of 742.5 to 1072.5 kcal is calculated. When rounding to
the nearest whole number, that range becomes 743 to 1073 kcal.

your response, which you will then type in the provided space.

pp. 25-26
Question 48

Effective chewing is an important aspect of which process?
O Satiety
© Nutrient absorption

© Chemical digestion
@ @ Mechanical digestion

That's right!

Rationale

Effective chewing is an important aspect of mechanical digestion. Teeth rhythmically tear and pulverize food
for digestion. Satiety refers to the feeling of satisfaction after eating. Nutrient absorption occurs mainly in the

small intestine. Chemical digestion prepares nutrients for the process of absorption.

pp. 23, 24
Question 49

Which statement about the classification of carbohydrates is incorrect?

©) "Fructose is a monosaccharide found naturally in fruits and honey."
@ ©@ "Glucose is a monosaccharide found naturally in almost all types of foods."
© "Cellulose is a nondigestible polysaccharide that adds bulk to the diet."

© "Sucrose is a disaccharide and is common ‘table’ sugar; it is found naturally in molasses."

That's right!

Rationale

Glucose is a monosaccharide and the form that circulates in the blood; it is found naturally in only a few
foods, most notably corn syrup. Fructose is the sweetest of the simple sugars and is a monosaccharide found
naturally in fruits and honey. Cellulose is classified as a polysaccharide. Sucrose is classified as a disaccharide.

p. 13
Question 50

Which saccharide is classified as a disaccharide? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [B] Maltose
@ |B] Sucrose
@ [B) Lactose

|_| Fructose

[| Galactose

That's right!

Rationale

Maltose, sucrose, and lactose are classified as disaccharides. Fructose and galactose are classified as
monosaccharides.

p.14
Question 51

Which statement about the classification of carbohydrates and their importance in nutrition
is correct?

© "Sucrose, maltose, and lactose are polysaccharides composed of various monosaccharides."
iv) © "Glucose, fructose, and galactose are all monosaccharides, which are important in human nutrition."

© "Sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol can be used freely to replace sugar without
adding kilocalories."

© "Oligosaccharides such as stachyose and raffinose are found naturally in most foods and provide the
greatest source of energy for the body."

That's right!

Rationale

Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrate and include glucose, fructose, and galactose, all of
which are important for human nutrition. Sucrose, maltose, and lactose are disaccharides, not
polysaccharides. Sugar alcohols can be used to lower carbohydrates but add kilocalories. Oligosaccharides are
not found in most foods; they are predominantly found in legumes.

p. 13
Question 52

Which statement accurately describes carbohydrates and their classifications? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B) "Carbohydrates are composed of three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen."

@ [BB] “The term saccharide is derived from the Latin word saccharum, which means sugar."

@ |B] "Carbohydrates are classified according to the number of saccharide units in each structure."

@ [BB] "Polysaccharides are large, complex compounds made up of many saccharide units in long chains."

[| "Monosaccharides are classified as simple carbohydrates, whereas disaccharides and polysaccharides
are considered complex carbohydrates."

That's right!

Rationale

Carbohydrates are composed of three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; the term CHO is a
combination of these chemical components. The term saccharide is derived from the Latin word saccharum,
which means sugar. The number of saccharide units that make up the structure of the carbohydrate is used to
classify a carbohydrate as simple or complex. Polysaccharides, such as starch, are large, complex compounds
composed of many saccharide units in long chains. Simple carbohydrates include both monosaccharides and
disaccharides.

p. 13
Question 53

Which statement concerning dietary fiber provides the best foundation for consumption of
dietary fiber to help address constipation?
© "Gastric emptying is decreased by dietary fibers, thus slowing digestion and gut transit time."

© "Soluble dietary fibers bind minerals, lipids, and bile acids, thus decreasing the excretion of each."
@ ©@ "Dietary fiber adds bulk to fecal matter, stimulating muscle action in the intestine."

© "Normal microflora in the colon use dietary fiber as a medium for microbial fermentation, leading to
synthesis of vitamins."

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary fiber provides bulk, which helps thicken chyme and eases the work of gastrointestinal muscles that
regulate movement of food mass, thus helping with constipation. Gastric emptying is decreased by more
soluble dietary fibers, thus slowing digestion, which could exacerbate constipation. Soluble dietary fibers do
bind minerals, lipids, and bile acids, thus increasing the excretion of each, but this does not directly address
constipation. Normal microflora in the colon use dietary fiber as a medium for microbial fermentation,
leading to synthesis of vitamins and formation of short-chain fatty acids to help to maintain the health of the

colon, but this statement does not specifically address constipation.

p. 16
Question 54

Which statement best describes the relationship between dietary fiber and glucose levels?

@ ©@ "Eating dietary fibers may help slow the absorption of glucose by my body."
© "Eating more high-fiber foods helps me feel fuller; thus, | will eat less sugary foods."

© "Fiber-containing foods may lower the availability of minerals, which can decrease glucose breakdown
for me."

© "Replacing high-fat foods with high-fiber foods helps decrease glucose levels in general."

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary fiber, such as soluble fiber, may cause slower absorption of glucose, thus helping keep blood glucose
levels within acceptable parameters. Increased consumption of high-fiber foods can help an individual feel
fuller but does not describe the relationship between dietary fiber and glucose. Fiber-containing foods may
bind minerals and lower their bioavailability, but this does not describe the relationship between dietary fiber
and glucose. Replacing high-fat foods with high-fiber foods helps lower dietary cholesterol and saturated fats,
but this does not describe the relationship between dietary fiber and glucose.

p.17
Question 55

Which common sugar found outside of plants promotes the absorption of calcium and
phosphorus?

O Sucrose
iv) © Lactose
O Maltose

O Galactose

That's right!

Rationale

Lactose, the sugar in milk, is the only common sugar that does not come from plants. Lactose promotes the
absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Sucrose is a common table sugar found in plants. Maltose results
from the breakdown of starch and is not usually found in food form unless it has been synthetically derived
and added to processed foods. Galactose is a product of lactose digestion and not commonly found as a free
monosaccharide in the diet. Although galactose promotes the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, it is not

a common sugar.

Test-Taking Tip: If you can eliminate any responses as incorrect based on your knowledge, you will not be

guessing randomly but will be exercising "informed guessing.’

p.14
Question 56

Soluble fiber helps lower blood cholesterol levels through which mechanism?

© Holding water
@ ©@ Binding bile acids
© Slowing digestion

O Functioning as an antioxidant

That's right!

Rationale

Soluble fiber binds bile acids, which ultimately helps lower blood cholesterol levels. Some soluble fibers hold
water, but this does not help lower cholesterol levels. Soluble fiber can slow digestion, but this does not help
lower cholesterol levels. Certain types of insoluble, not soluble, fibers function as antioxidants.

p. 16
Question 57

Which carbohydrate most efficiently adds important bulk to the diet?

O Dextrin
© Glycogen

ivy) © Cellulose

© Algal polysaccharides

That's right!

Rationale

Cellulose is a nondigestible polysaccharide that provides bulk to the diet. Dextrin and glycogen are digestible
polysaccharides; while they can also provide bulk, cellulose more efficiently adds bulk to the diet. Algal
polysaccharides are gel forming; they do not add bulk to the diet.

p. 16
Question 58

Which statement about digestion is correct?
@ @ "When | put food in my mouth, digestion is stimulated."

© "Digestion is stimulated once | begin to walk after eating."
©) "Digestion is stimulated by the secretion of intrinsic factor."

©) "Digestion begins once food reaches the small intestine.”

That's right!

Rationale

Putting food in the mouth stimulates digestion. Movement can enhance digestion, but digestion is
stimulated by putting food in the mouth. The stomach secretes intrinsic factor to absorb vitamin B 1, not to
trigger digestion. Most absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine, but digestion begins before that.

p. 22
Question 59

Which food meets high fiber needs by supplying at least 4 g of fiber per serving? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B) Kidney beans
[| Carrots
iv) [ml] Oatmeal

iv) [ml] Shredded wheat

@ [_| Spaghetti

So close!

Rationale

Many foods contain fiber. Kidney beans, oatmeal, shredded wheat, and spaghetti contain higher amounts of
fiber (approximately 4 g per serving) than do carrots, which contain approximately 2 g of fiber per serving.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words, (2) read each answer thoroughly to see if it completely covers the
material the question asks, and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

pp. 18-19
Question 60

Which food causes bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and diarrhea in individuals with lactose
intolerance? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Glass of milk

iv) [ml] Cheese and crackers
[| Half a turkey sandwich
iv) [ml] Slice of toast with butter
|_| Salad with low-fat dressing

That's right!

Rationale

Foods that include dairy products or items made with dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and butter, contain
lactose and may cause bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and diarrhea in a client with lactose intolerance. A turkey
sandwich and a salad with low-fat dressing likely do not contain high amounts of lactose.

Test-Taking Tip: If you can eliminate any responses as incorrect based on your knowledge, you will not be

guessing randomly but will be exercising "informed guessing.’

pp. 13, 23
Question 61

Which food sources supply carbohydrates in the form of naturally occurring sugars?
© Cakes and cookies

@ ©@ Fruit and dairy products
© Whole grains and cereals

© Legumes and rice

That's right!

Rationale
Fruit and dairy products are sources of naturally occurring sugars, including fructose and lactose. Cakes and

cookies contain added sugars, not naturally occurring sugars. Whole grains and cereals, as well as legumes
and rice, contain complex carbohydrates such as dietary fiber and are not sources of naturally occurring

sugars.

pp. 13-14
Question 62

Which statement about carbohydrate absorption is true?

© Chemical digestion of carbohydrates is completed in the large intestine.
© Stomach acid and enzymes increase amylase action for carbohydrate absorption.
©) Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the large intestine.

@ ©@ Carbohydrates must be broken down into monosaccharides before they can be absorbed into
circulation.

That's right!

Rationale

Carbohydrates must be broken down into monosaccharides before they can be absorbed into circulation.
Chemical digestion of carbohydrates is completed in the small intestine. Stomach acid and enzymes halt
amylase action. Digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth and progresses through the gastrointestinal
tract.

Question 63

What is the dietary reference intake (DRI) per day for carbohydrates for adults?

© 75 to 125g
© 150 to 200 g

@ @ 225 to 325¢

© 350 to 450 g

That's right!

Rationale

The DRIs recommend that 45% to 65% of total caloric intake come from carbohydrate foods; this translates to
225 to 325 g of carbohydrates for a 2000 kcal/day diet. Further, 75 to 125 g and 150 to 200 g are too low, and
350 to 450 g of carbohydrates is too high.

Question 1
a

In the United States, gestational diabetes accounts for what percentage of all pregnancies

annually?
OC 1%
@0%
@O ®@® 10%
OQ 13%

So close!

Rationale
The prevalence of gestational diabetes in the United States is approximately 7% of all pregnancies annually.
Gestational diabetes does not account for 1%, 10%, or 13% of all pregnancies annually in the United States.

pp. 368-369
Question 2
a

Which hemoglobin A ,, value would classify a patient as prediabetic?
OC 5%
Oo %

That's right!

Rationale
If the hemoglobin A ;, value is 5.7% to 6.4%, the patient is considered prediabetic. A normal hemoglobin A ,,

value is approximately 5%. If the hemoglobin A ;, value is 7% or 8%, the patient is considered diabetic.

pp. 370-371
Question 3

What is the 1-hour postprandial blood glucose goal for a patient with gestational diabetes?
© Less than 105 mg/dL

© Less than 110 mg/dL
© Less than 130 mg/dL

Less than 155 mg/dL
g/

That's right!

Rationale

During pregnancy, the recommended 1-hour postprandial blood glucose goal is less than 155 mg/dL. The
recommended fasting blood glucose goal during pregnancy is less than 105 mg/dL. A blood glucose level
lower than 110 mg/dL is not recommended during pregnancy. The recommended 2-hour postprandial blood
glucose goal during pregnancy is less than 130 mg/dL.

pp. 369-370
Question 4
Es

Chronic kidney disease and renal failure requiring dialysis develop in approximately what

percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes?

So close!

Rationale

Microvascular effects of type 1 diabetes include nephropathy and retinopathy. As a result of nephropathy,
chronic kidney disease and renal failure requiring dialysis develop in approximately 50% of all individuals with
type 1 diabetes. The percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes who develop chronic kidney disease and renal
failure is more than 5% and more than 20% but less than 80%.

p. 375
Question 5

Genetic predisposition and environmental factors are common with which type of diabetes?

@ © Type! diabetes

© © Type 2 diabetes
O Gestational diabetes

O Prediabetes

So close!

Rationale

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting in the destruction of beta cells. Genetic predisposition
and environmental factors are involved. One or more autoantibodies are present in the majority of individuals
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is an insidious disease; it is not uncommon for a person to
have type 2 diabetes years before diagnosis. Occasionally, the stress of pregnancy may induce gestational
diabetes. This is a form of glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy only. Prediabetes occurs before
type 2 diabetes.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very
cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and an absolute may be a
reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken
to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices.

pp. 366-367
Question 6

Which statement regarding type 1 diabetes is correct?

© "If | count carbohydrates, | may no longer need insulin."
@ ©@ "will always need to take insulin."
© "One dose of insulin per day is enough."

© "My blood glucose can be managed with diet and exercise."

That's right!

Rationale

Because patients with type 1 diabetes cannot make enough insulin on their own, they will always need to take
insulin. Even if they count carbohydrates as part of their nutrition plan, they will still need to take insulin. The
insulin is needed throughout the day, not just once per day. Blood glucose can be managed with diet and
exercise for some patients with type 2 diabetes but not for patients with type 1 diabetes because they cannot

make their own insulin.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary
circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 368
Question 7

What is often the first manifestation of type 1 diabetes?
O Coronary artery disease

©) Peripheral neuropathy
O Periodontitis
Cy) © Diabetic ketoacidosis

That's right!

Rationale

The first manifestation of type 1 diabetes is often diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a condition in
which the body produces large amounts of ketones related to the body’s inability to produce insulin. Coronary
artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, and periodontitis can be potential long-term complications of diabetes
mellitus.

pp. 366-367
Question &

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting in the destruction of which cells?

© Alpha cells of the pancreas
© Alpha cells of the liver

@ ©@ Beta cells of the pancreas
© Beta cells of the liver

That's right!

Rationale
Type 1 diabetes results in the destruction of beta cells in the pancreas. The alpha cells of the pancreas are

responsible for producing glucagon and still function normally in patients with type 1 diabetes. No beta or
alpha cells are found in the liver.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that 2 of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

pp. 366-367
Question 9

When should patients to be tested for gestational diabetes?
O Postpartum

tx} © First trimester

O Third trimester

Cy) O Second trimester

So close!

Rationale

All women should undergo screening for gestational diabetes during the second trimester because
gestational diabetes occurs most commonly after 20 weeks of gestation. Women should not be initially tested
for gestational diabetes during the postpartum period because this is too late. The first trimester is too early,
and the third trimester is too late.

pp. 368-369
Question 10

What is a basic goal of nutrition therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes?
O Weight loss

© Weight gain
@ ©@ Maintenance of a lean weight

© Weight is not a factor in type 1 diabetes management

That's right!

Rationale
Adults with type 1 diabetes tend to have a lean weight, and maintaining it is a basic goal. Weight loss or
weight gain in a patient with type 1 diabetes can lead to complications. Weight is a factor to consider in type 1

diabetes management.

p. 382
Question 11

Why is exercise important for a patient with type 2 diabetes who is already maintaining a
healthy weight?
x) © To potentiate the activation of insulin
O To decrease the effects of glucose
rv) O To improve cellular uptake of glucose

O To promote a negative energy balance

So close!

Rationale

Exercise is important for a patient with type 2 diabetes who is already maintaining a healthy weight because it
improves cellular uptake of glucose. Exercise does not potentiate the activation of insulin or decrease the
effects of glucose. Exercise requires energy, which is supplied by glucose; therefore exercise lowers the glucose

level, not the effect of glucose. A patient who is not overweight does not need a negative energy balance.

p. 378
Question 12

Which macronutrient primarily influences the postprandial glycemic response?

@ ©@ Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale
Carbohydrates primarily influence the postprandial glycemic response. Fats and proteins are not the primary
influence on the postprandial glycemic response. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose; glucose itself

is not a macronutrient.

p. 382
Question 13

Which factor must be considered when implementing medical nutrition therapy for a
patient with type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

M| Age

Food preferences

Meal schedules

|
| Metabolic goals
_
_

Physical activity

So close!

Rationale

Patient food preferences, metabolic goals, meal schedules, and physical activity should be considered when
implementing medical nutrition therapy for a patient with type 2 diabetes. Age must be considered only if it
affects one of the other factors.

p. 380
Question 14
SS

A dietitian is helping a patient with type 1 diabetes plan a daily nutrition schedule. Which
factor should the dietitian discuss with the patient? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Cy) | Blood glucose should be monitored.

@ |B] Food distribution needs to be planned ahead when using insulin.

A daily nutrition plan should be the same every day.

@ [BN] Stress can cause a glycemic response and can alter nutrition needs.

A daily nutrition plan for adults is essentially the same as a nutrition plan for children and
adolescents.

That's right!

Rationale

Blood glucose needs to be monitored to prevent hypoglycemia. Food distribution needs to be planned ahead
when using insulin and should be adjusted according to the day’s scheduled activities. A stressful event caused
by any source causes an adrenaline rush, a fight-or-flight effect that counteracts insulin activity and can
contribute to a glycemic response. A nutrition plan should be adjusted daily based on schedules and stressful
periods. When developing a nutrition plan for children and adolescents, consideration needs to be given to

their activity level, growth spurts, and changing hormone patterns; this is not true for adults.

p. 380
Question 15

What is true regarding exercise for patients with type 1 diabetes?
© Patients with type 1 diabetes should not exercise.

© Patients with type 1 diabetes should avoid exercise if their fasting blood glucose level is greater than
150 mg/dL.

© Patients with type 1 diabetes should engage only in low-impact types of exercise.

@ ©@ Patients with type 1 diabetes should not perform exercise when insulin is at its peak.

That's right!

Rationale

When insulin is at its peak, a patient’s blood glucose is at its lowest. Because exercise can also lower blood
glucose, patients should avoid exercise when insulin is at its peak in order to prevent hypoglycemia. Patients
with type 1 diabetes are encouraged to exercise but should avoid exercise when their fasting blood glucose
level is greater than 300 mg/dL. As long as the patient does not have complications and their blood glucose is

under control, the patient can perform all levels of exercise.

p. 385
Question 16

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) endorses which type of diet for type 1 diabetes

management?

O No concentrated sweets

O No sugar added

O Low sugar
rv) © The ADA does not endorse any specific diet

That's right!

Rationale

There is no "ideal" diabetic or "ADA diet." Diet orders such as "no concentrated sweets," "no sugar added," and
“low sugar" are not suitable because they do not reflect diabetes nutrition recommendations or individual
requirements and may pointlessly restrict sucrose.

p. 368
Question 17

In addition to glucose management, which intervention can slow the progression of
nephropathy and end-stage renal disease?

O Smoking cessation
O Ongoing eye evaluations
rv) © Antihypertensive therapy

O Reduction of triglyceride levels

That's right!

Rationale

Improved glucose management and antihypertensive therapy can slow the progression of nephropathy and
end-stage renal disease. Smoking cessation is one of the recommendations for the prevention and
management of CVD. Ongoing eye evaluations are an important part of the care plan for diabetic patients

with retinopathy. Reduction of triglyceride levels is recommended to manage hyperlipidemia.

pp. 375-376
Question 18

Patients with prediabetes would have which fasting blood glucose value?
© 70 mg/dL

© 90 mg/dL
@ © 110 mg/d
© @ 130 mg/d

So close!

Rationale

Patients with prediabetes have a fasting blood glucose value of 100 to 125 mg/dL. The normal range is 99
mg/dL or below. Patients with diabetes have a fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dL or above. A fasting blood
glucose value of 130 mg/dL indicates diabetes.

pp. 370-371
Question 19

Which of the following is a sign or symptom of gestational diabetes? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.
x) m| Headache

mw) Blurred vision

Ringing in ears

Sudden blindness

| Weight loss with increased appetite

iv)
rv) wl Increased thirst
iv)

So close!

Rationale

Signs and symptoms of gestational diabetes include blurred vision, increased thirst, and weight loss with
increased appetite. Headache, ringing in ears, and sudden blindness are signs and symptoms of preeclampsia

in pregnancy.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 371
Question 20

Which of the following statements is correct regarding an increased risk for developing type
2 diabetes?

O "You have elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels."
O "Your grandmother had type 2 diabetes."
rv) © "You have a history of gestational diabetes."

O "You are over 35 years old and have a body mass index (BMI) of 20 kg/m 2 or more."

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse’s response will be "You have a history of gestational diabetes." Women with a history of gestational
diabetes or who have delivered an infant weighing 9 Ib or more have a higher risk for type 2 diabetes.
Elevated high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels are not a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. A first-degree
relative with type 2 diabetes places the patient at risk for type 2 diabetes, but a grandmother is a second-
degree relative. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include age greater than 45 years and a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 or

more,

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,
pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 368
Question 21

What is the definition of prediabetes?

@ ©@ Glucose levels that do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are still considered high risk for
developing diabetes

© Acondition of the pituitary gland and insufficiency of vasopressin characterized by copious output of
nonsweet urine, great thirst, and sometimes a large appetite

O Sudden, severe insulin deficiency requiring insulin therapy to prevent ketoacidosis, coma, and death

O Carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy

That's right!

Rationale

Prediabetes is defined by glucose levels that do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are still considered high
risk for developing the disease. A condition of the pituitary gland and insufficiency of vasopressin
characterized by copious output of a nonsweet urine, great thirst, and sometimes a large appetite is diabetes
insipidus. Sudden, severe insulin deficiency requiring insulin therapy to prevent ketoacidosis, coma, and
death is type 1 diabetes. Carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity with onset or first recognition during

pregnancy is gestational diabetes.

pp. 370-371
Question 22

Which herb or supplement can safely be used for glycemic control with no concern for drug

interactions?

rv) O Cinnamon
x) © Ginseng

O Vanadium

O Evening primrose oil

So close!

Rationale

Cinnamon is the only herb listed that can help with glycemic control and has no known drug-herb interaction.
Ginseng interacts with hyperglycemic agents and any other agent used for glycemic control. It may also
enhance the effect of stimulants, antibiotics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Vanadium might cause
hypoglycemia if used in conjunction with an effective antidiabetic regimen. Evening primrose oil interacts

with phenothiazines.

p. 383
Question 23

Which laboratory test should a patient with prediabetes expect the health care provider to
order?

rv) © Fasting blood glucose
O Blood glucose before lunch

O Blood glucose after lunch
O Blood glucose after breakfast

That's right!

Rationale

Diabetes is usually diagnosed and characterized by elevated fasting blood glucose values. To test fasting blood
glucose, the patient needs to avoid eating for at least 8 hours before the test. A patient’s blood glucose level
before a meal is not necessarily accurate if the patient has not been fasting long enough. Testing after
breakfast or lunch does not allow for an accurate result.

pp. 370-371
Question 24

One carbohydrate serving equals how many grams of carbohydrates?

x HO) 10g

So close!

Rationale
Carbohydrate content can be measured in grams of carbohydrates or servings; one carbohydrate serving
equals 15 g of carbohydrates. Although 10 g is not enough to be a serving of carbohydrates, 20 g and 25 g are

more than what is in one serving of carbohydrates.

p. 382
Question 25

What is an expected assessment finding for a patient with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)?

tx} © Glucosuria
@ © Dyslipidemia

O Diabetic ketoacidosis

© Unintentional weight loss

So close!

Rationale
Dyslipidemia is an expected assessment finding for a patient with IGT. IGT is a strong risk factor for the
development of type 2 diabetes, which can result from underlying conditions such as dyslipidemia.

Glucosuria, diabetic ketoacidosis, and unintentional weight loss are associated with type 1, not type 2,
diabetes.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the

material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 376
Question 26

What happens to beta cell function in type 2 diabetes?

Cy) © Hyperinsulinemia occurs.
© Glucose attacks beta cells.

O Insulin resistance occurs in beta cells.

© Residual insulin is produced after the "honeymoon period."

That's right!

Rationale
Type 2 diabetes alters beta cell function, resulting in excess insulin production or hyperinsulinemia. Glucose

does not attack beta cells; beta cells produce insulin to carry glucose into the cells. Insulin resistance occurs in
cells that use insulin, not those that produce it. Residual insulin is produced after the "honeymoon period" in

type 1 diabetes.

p. 368
Question 27

Of which additional risk factor must the nurse be aware when providing education to a
patient of East Asian descent with type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Stroke

Cy) Cancer

Liver disease

Thyroid disorders

Cy) | Renal disorders

So close!

Rationale

When providing education to a patient of East Asian descent with type 2 diabetes, the nurse should discuss
the additional risk factors for stroke, cancer, and renal disorders. A patient of East Asian descent with type 2

diabetes does not have an increased risk for liver disease or thyroid disorders.

p. 375
Question 28

Which statement most accurately describes gestational diabetes?

© "You are at the highest risk in the first 20 weeks of gestation because insulin sensitivity is decreased
by placental and ovarian hormones, and the pancreas cannot compensate."

© "You are at the highest risk in the first 20 weeks of gestation because insulin sensitivity is increased by
placental and ovarian hormones, and the pancreas cannot compensate."

rv) © "You are at the highest risk after the first 20 weeks of gestation because insulin sensitivity is decreased
by placental and ovarian hormones, and the pancreas cannot compensate."

© "You are at the highest risk after the first 20 weeks of gestation because insulin sensitivity is increased
by placental and ovarian hormones, and the pancreas cannot compensate."

That's right!

Rationale

Gestational diabetes occurs most commonly after the 20th week of gestation. In nondiabetic women,
placental and ovarian hormones decrease insulin sensitivity, and the pancreas cannot compensate. Pregnant
women do not usually develop gestational diabetes in the first 20 weeks of gestation. Placental and ovarian

hormones do not increase insulin sensitivity during pregnancy.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

pp. 368-369
Question 29
|

A 40-year-old pregnant patient presents to the gynecology office with a chief complaint of
fatigue during her second trimester. She also tells the nurse, "It seems like | am urinating
frequently, and | cannot get enough water." What condition is the patient most likely
experiencing?

O Preeclampsia

O Phenylketonuria

rv) © Gestational diabetes

O Hyperemesis gravidarum

That's right!

Rationale

The patient is experiencing symptoms related to gestational diabetes: increased thirst, increased urination,
and fatigue. She also has the risk factor of advanced maternal age. Preeclampsia symptoms include a severe
rise in blood pressure, rapid weight gain, marked edema, headache, decreased urine output, and dizziness.
Phenylketonuria is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by extremely low levels of the enzyme
phenylalanine hydroxylase. Hyperemesis gravidarum symptoms include severe and unrelenting vomiting.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple choice questions can be challenging, because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 371
Question 30

Which statement is correct regarding potential complications of poorly controlled

gestational diabetes?

x) © "If | do not follow the treatment plan, | could have a miscarriage."
O "If | do not follow the treatment plan, my baby could have trouble gaining weight."
O "If | do not follow the treatment plan, my baby could have a low birth weight."

rv) O "If | do not follow the treatment plan, my baby could be born with a larger body size than normal."

So close!

Rationale

The most common outcome for an infant born to a mother with gestational diabetes is macrosomia, a larger-
than-normal body size. Miscarriages are a complication related to bulimia nervosa in the mother. Difficulty
gaining weight and having a low birth weight are common conditions of infants born to mothers with bulimia

nervosa.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 370
Question 31

Which of the following statements is true regarding insulin therapy for gestational
diabetes?

O “If | maintain a healthy body mass index, | will not need insulin."
O “| can eat whatever | want as long as | take my insulin every day."
O “It is alright to not take my insulin as long as | exercise regularly."

rv) © "| need to take my insulin to prevent type 2 diabetes after the baby is born."

That's right!

Rationale

For women who are unable to maintain their glucose levels within an acceptable range, insulin therapy is
recommended. Strict adherence to insulin therapy can prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes. Along
with insulin therapy, women are advised to maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI), but a healthy BMI is
not a substitute for insulin therapy. Women with gestational diabetes are advised to maintain a balanced diet
with insulin therapy. Women with gestational diabetes are advised to maintain a regular exercise schedule

while adhering to the insulin regimen. However, exercising does not take the place of insulin therapy.

pp. 369-370
Question 32

When educating a pregnant patient with gestational diabetes on nutrition, what

recommendation should the nurse include?

O Increase saturated fats.
rv) © Pair fiber intake with fluids.
O Restrict sodium intake.

O Eat carbohydrates in the morning.

That's right!

Rationale

Pregnant women with gestational diabetes should maintain an adequate intake of fiber along with fluids to
prevent constipation. Saturated fats should be limited with gestational diabetes. Sodium is not routinely
restricted with gestational diabetes. Carbohydrates should be eaten throughout the day rather than only in the
morning.

p. 383
Question 33

A pregnant patient diagnosed with gestational diabetes is receiving information on
maintaining a balanced diet throughout the pregnancy. The patient’s recommended body
weight for pregnancy is 90 kg (198 Ib). What is this patient’s recommended daily protein
intake?

O 72g
O®
OO %8

OC 108¢

So close!

Rationale

The recommended daily protein intake for a patient with gestational diabetes with a recommended body
weight of 90 kg for pregnancy is 1.1 g of protein per kilogram of recommended body weight, which equals 99
g of daily protein for this patient. Intakes of 72 g and 90 g are too low. An intake of 108 g is too high.

p. 384
Question 34

Which sign or symptom do patients with type 1 diabetes often experience? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Weight loss

| Polyphagia

Polyuria

Decrease in appetite

| Weight gain

| Incontinence

So close!

Rationale

Cells use glucose for energy; without endogenous insulin, cells begin to starve. The body responds by sending
signals to eat because cells are hungry. Because the end product of digestion (glucose) cannot enter cells,
glucose builds up in the bloodstream. It is common for the patient with type 1 diabetes to experience weight
loss despite consuming large quantities of food (polyphagia). Because glucose cannot enter cells and builds
up in the bloodstream, blood becomes hypertonic, and the body tries to get rid of the excess glucose by
increasing urine output (polyuria). In reaction to increased excretion of urine, the body again responds by
increasing thirst (polydipsia) to replace lost fluids. Because of this, the patient with type 1 diabetes experiences
an increase in appetite and weight loss (not weight gain). Even though patients will have an increase in urine

output, they will not experience incontinence related to type 1 diabetes.

p. 371
Question 35

What result indicates that the patient will be diagnosed with gestational diabetes?
© Fasting blood glucose level of 91 mg/dL

© Blood glucose level of 175 mg/dL 1 hour after oral glucose tolerance test
© Blood glucose level of 150 mg/dL 1 hour after oral glucose tolerance test

@ ©@ Blood glucose level of 155 mg/dL 2 hours after oral glucose tolerance test

That's right!

Rationale

The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made when the plasma glucose value exceeds 155 mg/dL 2 hours
after the oral glucose tolerance test. A fasting blood glucose result exceeding 92 mg/dL is needed to diagnose
gestational diabetes. A blood glucose level of greater than 180 mg/dL is needed to diagnose gestational
diabetes 1 hour after the oral glucose tolerance test, so blood glucose levels of 175 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL 1
hour after the test do not indicate gestational diabetes.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

pp. 368-369
Question 36

Teaching about carbohydrate counting has been effective when the prediabetic patient

makes which statement?

x) © "One carbohydrate serving equals 10 g of carbohydrates."
O "Half a cup of dried fruit is one serving of carbohydrates."
O “If ’'m counting carbohydrates, | no longer need insulin."

rv) O "One cup of milk is equal to one carbohydrate serving."

So close!

Rationale

One cup of milk is equal to one carbohydrate serving. One carbohydrate serving equals 15 g of carbohydrates.
A quarter cup of dried fruit is one serving of carbohydrates. Patients may still require insulin when counting

carbohydrates.

p. 385
Question 37

Patients with prediabetes would have which fasting blood glucose value?

© 70 mg/dL
© 90 mg/dL

@ @ 110 mg/d

130 mg/dL
g/

That's right!

Rationale

Patients with prediabetes have a fasting blood glucose value of 100 to 125 mg/dL. The normal range is 99
mg/dL or below. Patients with diabetes have a fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dL or above. A fasting blood
glucose value of 130 mg/dL indicates diabetes.

pp. 370-371
Question 38

Which of the following is a sign or symptom of gestational diabetes? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.
Headache

rv) mw) Blurred vision

Ringing in ears

rv) wl Increased thirst

Sudden blindness

rv) | Weight loss with increased appetite

That's right!

Rationale

Signs and symptoms of gestational diabetes include blurred vision, increased thirst, and weight loss with
increased appetite. Headache, ringing in ears, and sudden blindness are signs and symptoms of preeclampsia

in pregnancy.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 39

Which herb or supplement can safely be used for glycemic control with no concern for drug

interactions?

rv) © Cinnamon
O Ginseng

O Vanadium

O Evening primrose oil

That's right!

Rationale

Cinnamon is the only herb listed that can help with glycemic control and has no known drug-herb interaction.
Ginseng interacts with hyperglycemic agents and any other agent used for glycemic control. It may also
enhance the effect of stimulants, antibiotics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Vanadium might cause
hypoglycemia if used in conjunction with an effective antidiabetic regimen. Evening primrose oil interacts

with phenothiazines.

Question 40

One carbohydrate serving equals how many grams of carbohydrates?

That's right!

Rationale

Carbohydrate content can be measured in grams of carbohydrates or servings; one carbohydrate serving
equals 15 g of carbohydrates. Although 10 g is not enough to be a serving of carbohydrates, 20 g and 25 g are
more than what is in one serving of carbohydrates.

Question 41

What is an expected assessment finding for a patient with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)?
© Glucosuria

@ © Dyslipidemia

O Diabetic ketoacidosis

© Unintentional weight loss

That's right!

Rationale
Dyslipidemia is an expected assessment finding for a patient with IGT. IGT is a strong risk factor for the
development of type 2 diabetes, which can result from underlying conditions such as dyslipidemia.

Glucosuria, diabetic ketoacidosis, and unintentional weight loss are associated with type 1, not type 2,
diabetes.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 376
Question 42

Which dietary consideration is necessary for the patient with type 2 diabetes before

moderately exercising for 1 hour?
rv) © No modifications are necessary.

O Two carbohydrate servings are recommended.
O One carbohydrate serving is recommended.

O Modifications are unnecessary unless the blood glucose level is less than 100 mg/dL.

That's right!

Rationale

There is no dietary modification recommended for the patient with type 2 diabetes before moderately
exercising for 1 hour. Two carbohydrate servings are recommended for a patient with type 1 diabetes who will
exercise strenuously for 1 to 2 hours. One carbohydrate serving is recommended for a patient with type 1

diabetes who will exercise moderately for 1 hour. Dietary modifications are unnecessary unless the blood
glucose is less than 100 mg/dL for a patient with type 1 diabetes.

p. 385
Question 43

Which group of patients has a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
Whites

Hispanics

Latino Americans

Native Americans

African Americans

That's right!

Rationale

Hispanics, Latino Americans, Native Americans, and African Americans have a higher risk for developing type
2 diabetes. White patients do not have a pronounced risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

p. 368
Question 44

Which objective is accurate for a patient with prediabetes? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Maintaining optimal nutrition

Using aggressive insulin therapy

m| Preventing hyperglycemia

Preventing complications

m| Following American Diabetes Association (ADA) nutrition guidelines

So close!

Rationale

Maintaining optimal nutrition, preventing hyperglycemia, and preventing complications are all objectives for
a patient with prediabetes. Aggressive insulin therapy would not be necessary for a patient with prediabetes.
The ADA does not sanction any single meal plan or specific percentages of nutrients for prediabetes.

p. 371
Question 45

What is true regarding alcohol consumption and prediabetic and diabetic patients?

© Alcohol should be consumed on an empty stomach.
@ ©@ Alcohol consumption can increase serum cholesterol levels.
© Alcohol consumption has no effect on neuropathy.

© Alcohol consumption cannot lead to hypoglycemia.

That's right!

Rationale

Alcohol consumption can lead to increased serum cholesterol levels. Alcohol should never be consumed on an
empty stomach. Alcohol can make neuropathy worse. Alcohol consumption can lead to hypoglycemia. Because
the liver plays the biggest role in removing alcohol from the blood, it stops making glucose while cleansing
alcohol from the body. If blood glucose levels are falling during the same time, hypoglycemia can occur very
quickly.

p. 383
Question 46

A clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes requires a blood glucose level of at least what

amount? Record you answer using a whole number. @}| 110 @| 126 mg/dL

So close!

Rationale
The blood glucose level for a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is 126 mg/dL or greater.

p. 371
Question 47

Which gradual-onset symptom occurs with type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Polyuria

| Fatigue

Hypoglycemia

m| Upper-body obesity

iv)
rv) | Frequent infection
x)

So close!

Rationale

The gradual-onset symptoms that occur with type 2 diabetes include polyuria, fatigue, and frequent
infections. Hypoglycemia primarily occurs with type 1 diabetes. Upper-body obesity is an increased risk factor
for type 2 diabetes.

p. 371
Question 48

Which of the following statements regarding carbohydrate intake and type 1 diabetes is

incorrect?

O "Carbohydrate intake should be consistent throughout the day."
rv) O "Sucrose-containing foods should be eliminated."
x) © "Fruits and vegetables are considered carbohydrates."

O "Sugar-sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided."

So close!

Rationale

Sucrose-containing foods do not have to be eliminated from the diet. Eating a sucrose-containing food will
have a similar blood glucose effect as eating another complex carbohydrate-containing food of equal caloric
value. Carbohydrate intake should be consistent throughout the day. Fruits and vegetables are considered
carbohydrates, and sugar-sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided. These are all guidelines for
glycemic control for the patient with type 1 diabetes.

p. 383
Question 49

What is the best response for a patient who asks, "How can | control my type 2 diabetes?"

© "You are encouraged to exercise 45 minutes daily."
© "You need to lose 15% of your current body weight."

@ ©@ "I would like to discuss the Mediterranean diet with you."

© "You need to think about what lifestyle changes you are going to make."

That's right!

Rationale

The best response by the nurse for the patient who asks, "How can | control my type 2 diabetes?" is "| would
like to discuss the Mediterranean diet with you." A healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, is a primary
intervention for a patient with type 2 diabetes. Physical activity of at least 150 minutes per week is encouraged
to promote and maintain a weight loss of 10% to 15% of body weight. Not all patients need to lose 15% of
their body weight. Making a statement such as, "You need to think about what lifestyle changes you are going
to make" is not therapeutic and provides no support or direction for the patient.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 383
Question 50

Which dietary strategy should a nurse recommend for a patient with type 2 diabetes?
© Increasing frequency of meals

©) Decreasing dietary caloric intake
© Implementing a low-carbohydrate diet

@ ©@ Planning regular times for meals and snacks

That's right!

Rationale

Planning regular times for meals and snacks is a dietary strategy a nurse should recommend for a patient with
type 2 diabetes. Increasing the frequency of meals is sometimes recommended for a patient with type 1
diabetes. Decreasing the dietary caloric intake is only beneficial if the patient is overweight. Low-carbohydrate
diets are not recommended for the management of diabetes.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 385
Question 51

Which dietary recommendation is applicable for a patient with type 2 diabetes?
© Follow restrictions for dietary protein.

© ©@ Increase dietary fiber beyond the recommended dietary allowance (RDA).
©) Fats should comprise no more than 20% of the diet.

Cy) O Nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners can be consumed.

So close!

Rationale

Type 2 diabetic patients can consume nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners. There are no restrictions for

dietary protein unless the patient has diabetic nephropathy. There are no special recommendations for dietary
fiber intake beyond the RDA. There is no evidence that supports a specific recommendation for dietary fat
consumption as a percentage of the diet.

p. 384
Question 52

Which micronutrient supplementation is recommended for a patient with type 2 diabetes?

© Mineral supplementation enhances wellness.
Cy) © Micronutrient supplementation is not necessary.
© Vitamin supplementation helps maintain body function.

© Routine antioxidant supplementation protects the cells in the body.

That's right!

Rationale
Micronutrient supplementation for a patient with type 2 diabetes is not necessary unless there are underlying
deficiencies. Mineral, vitamin, and antioxidant supplementation may be applicable for a patient with type 2

diabetes who has other nutrition deficiencies.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid taking a wild guess at an answer. However, should you feel insecure about a question,
eliminate the alternatives that you believe are definitely incorrect, and reread the information given to make
sure you understand the intent of the question. This approach increases your chances of randomly selecting

the correct answer or getting a clearer understanding of what is being asked.

p. 383
Question 53

Which statement is true regarding nutrition therapy for type 1 diabetes? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Nutrition therapy should be individualized.
Patients should develop consistent eating patterns.

Patients with type 1 diabetes should follow the same nutrition recommendations for total fat that are
established for the general population.

Patients with type 1 diabetes should follow the same nutrition recommendations for protein that are
established for the general population.

Patients with type 1 diabetes should always avoid alcohol.

So close!

Rationale

No standard diabetic diet exists; therefore, nutrition therapy should be individualized. A consistent eating

pattern will lead to better glycemic control. Nutrition recommendations are the same for individuals with

diabetes as for the general population in regard to total fat. However, recommendations for protein are

modified. Alcohol can be consumed, but considerations must be made because alcohol can cause

hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

p. 380
Question 54

Which aspect of health plays a role in prediabetes management? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Physical health

Intellectual health

Emotional health

Social health

Religious health

Environmental health

So close!

Rationale

lifestyle modifications. The ability of the individual to understand the condition; be compliant on a regular
basis regarding insulin injections, if required; and follow dietary and exercise recommendations depend on
intellectual health. Emotional health is affected because the individual must deal with a chronic lifelong
condition, as well as changes in dietary habits that may necessitate the loss of favorite foods. Support,
especially from family members and friends, is a crucial part of social health. The environmental health
dimension can support prediabetes management based on the availability and means to access prediabetes
management health care. Spiritual, not religious, health may affect diabetes management.

p. 371
Question 55

Which of the following applies to a patient with type 1 diabetes who is susceptible to

hypoglycemia. Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Avoid taking insulin.

Cy) | Increase food intake if exercise increases.

Decrease carbohydrate intake.

@ |B] Take a glucose tablet when first experiencing signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

Cy) Make sure any alcohol is consumed with food.

So close!

Rationale

An increase in exercise can lead to hypoglycemia, so a patient with type 1 diabetes will need to increase food
intake if exercise is increased. If a patient is having signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, taking a glucose
tablet right away will prevent losing consciousness. Alcohol should be consumed with food to prevent
hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. A patient with type 1 diabetes will always need to take insulin. Hypoglycemia
can occur if the patient does not consume enough carbohydrates; intake should be consistent throughout the

day.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 376
Question 56

Which factor characterizes prediabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

rv) m| Impaired fasting glucose

Normal glucose tolerance test

rv) m| Abdominal obesity

Normal blood pressure

rv) | High triglycerides

High level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol

That's right!

Rationale

Patients are considered to have prediabetes if they have impaired fasting blood glucose, abdominal obesity,
and high triglycerides. Patients with prediabetes also have an impaired glucose tolerance test (not normal),
hypertension (not normal blood pressure), and a low level of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol.

pp. 370-371
Question 57

Which is true regarding nutrition therapy for patients with prediabetes or diabetes? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | It supports and facilitates individual lifestyle and behavioral changes.

| Cultural and ethnic preferences should be taken into account.

t improves health through healthy food choices only.

x) m| It addresses chronic complications once prediabetes or diabetes is diagnosed.

| It assesses an individual’s wishes and willingness to change.

So close!

Rationale

The objective of nutrition therapy is to support and facilitate individual lifestyle and behavioral changes that
will lead to improved glycemic control. Cultural and ethnic preferences should be taken into consideration
while respecting the individual’s wishes and willingness to change. Improved health should focus on healthy
food choices as well as physical activity. Chronic complications should be prevented if possible and treated if

they already exist.

p. 381
Question 58

Dietary prescriptions for diabetes are based on which factors?

© Treatment goals and amount of daily physical activity
© © Age and individual nutrition assessment
@ © Individual nutrition assessment and treatment goals

© Treatment goals and age

So close!

Rationale

Nutritional therapy for prediabetes and diabetes is highly individualized. The American Diabetes Association
(ADA) recommendations clearly state that no single diabetic or ADA diet exists. Today, the recommendation
diet is a dietary prescription based on individual nutrition assessment and treatment goals. Physical activity
requires advanced planning but is not part of all dietary prescription. Age is not necessarily a factor in dietary

prescription whether it is paired with individual nutrition assessment or treatment goals.

p. 381
Question 59

Which statement is correct regarding optimal consumption of carbohydrates with
gestational diabetes?

O "| eat carbohydrates in the morning only."
rv) © "| eat carbohydrates throughout the day."
O "Carbohydrates are eaten at dinner only."

O "| make sure to eat carbohydrates at lunch only."

That's right!

Rationale

The recommendation for patients with gestational diabetes is to distribute carbohydrate consumption
throughout the day. Carbohydrates should not be consumed only in the morning, only at dinner, or only at

lunch.

pp. 369-370
Question 60

Which patient education topic is the highest priority for someone with gestational diabetes
who is having difficulty maintaining glycemic control with adequate medical nutrition

therapy and regular exercise?

O Planning an exercise routine
@ © Understanding insulin therapy
©, Developing meal plans each week
© © Maintaining a healthy body mass index (BMI)

So close!

Rationale

When a patient with gestational diabetes is having difficulty maintaining glycemic control through diet and
exercise, insulin may be prescribed in addition to medical nutrition therapy to reduce the risks of fetal
macrosomia, neonatal hyperglycemia, and perinatal mortality. Therefore, the nurse should be prepared to
teach the patient about insulin therapy. Planning an exercise routine is not a priority. Developing weekly meal

plans may help, but it is not the priority. Maintaining a healthy BMI is important, but it is not the priority.

pp. 369-370
Question 61

Which of the following statements about nutrition therapy and type 1 diabetes is correct?

© "Daily intake of kilocalories should come mostly from carbohydrates."

© "It is not necessary to plan specific times to eat as long as | eat the recommended amount of
carbohydrates per day."

Cy) © "| will need extra food for unusual exercise."

© "During illness, | should avoid carbohydrates."

That's right!

Rationale

Extra food for unusual exercise is needed to help prevent hypoglycemia. Daily intake of kilocalories should
come not just from carbohydrates but also proteins and fats. It is extremely important to plan regular times
for meals and snacks to prevent hypoglycemia. During illness, the patient should consume small, frequent

meals of carbohydrates to prevent starvation ketoacidosis.

p. 380
Question 62

Which objective is accurate for a patient with prediabetes? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Maintaining optimal nutrition

Using aggressive insulin therapy

rv) m| Preventing hyperglycemia

Following American Diabetes Association (ADA) nutrition guidelines

That's right!

Rationale

Maintaining optimal nutrition, preventing hyperglycemia, and preventing complications are all objectives for
a patient with prediabetes. Aggressive insulin therapy would not be necessary for a patient with prediabetes.
The ADA does not sanction any single meal plan or specific percentages of nutrients for prediabetes.

Question 63

A clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes requires a blood glucose level of at least what

amount? Record you answer using a whole number. @}| 110 @| 126 mg/dL

So close!

Rationale
The blood glucose level for a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is 126 mg/dL or greater.

p. 371
Question 64

Which gradual-onset symptom occurs with type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Polyuria
rv) | Fatigue

Hypoglycemia

rv) | Frequent infection

Upper-body obesity

That's right!

Rationale

The gradual-onset symptoms that occur with type 2 diabetes include polyuria, fatigue, and frequent
infections. Hypoglycemia primarily occurs with type 1 diabetes. Upper-body obesity is an increased risk factor
for type 2 diabetes.

p. 371
Question 65

Which of the following statements regarding carbohydrate intake and type 1 diabetes is
incorrect?

O "Carbohydrate intake should be consistent throughout the day."
rv) © "Sucrose-containing foods should be eliminated."
O "Fruits and vegetables are considered carbohydrates."

O "Sugar-sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided."

That's right!

Rationale

Sucrose-containing foods do not have to be eliminated from the diet. Eating a sucrose-containing food will
have a similar blood glucose effect as eating another complex carbohydrate-containing food of equal caloric
value. Carbohydrate intake should be consistent throughout the day. Fruits and vegetables are considered
carbohydrates, and sugar-sweetened beverages should be limited or avoided. These are all guidelines for
glycemic control for the patient with type 1 diabetes.

Question 70

Which is true regarding nutrition therapy for patients with prediabetes or diabetes? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | It supports and facilitates individual lifestyle and behavioral changes.

rv) | Cultural and ethnic preferences should be taken into account.

t improves health through healthy food choices only.

t addresses chronic complications once prediabetes or diabetes is diagnosed.

rv) | It assesses an individual’s wishes and willingness to change.

That's right!

Rationale

The objective of nutrition therapy is to support and facilitate individual lifestyle and behavioral changes that
will lead to improved glycemic control. Cultural and ethnic preferences should be taken into consideration
while respecting the individual’s wishes and willingness to change. Improved health should focus on healthy
food choices as well as physical activity. Chronic complications should be prevented if possible and treated if

they already exist.

p. 381
Question 71

Dietary prescriptions for diabetes are based on which factors?

© Treatment goals and amount of daily physical activity
© Age and individual nutrition assessment
@ ©@ Individual nutrition assessment and treatment goals

© Treatment goals and age

That's right!

Rationale

Nutritional therapy for prediabetes and diabetes is highly individualized. The American Diabetes Association
(ADA) recommendations clearly state that no single diabetic or ADA diet exists. Today, the recommendation
diet is a dietary prescription based on individual nutrition assessment and treatment goals. Physical activity
requires advanced planning but is not part of all dietary prescription. Age is not necessarily a factor in dietary

prescription whether it is paired with individual nutrition assessment or treatment goals.

Of which additional risk factor must the nurse be aware when providing education to a
patient of East Asian descent with type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.
Cy) | Stroke

Cy) @| Cancer

Liver disease

Thyroid disorders

Cy) | Renal disorders

That's right!

Rationale

When providing education to a patient of East Asian descent with type 2 diabetes, the nurse should discuss
the additional risk factors for stroke, cancer, and renal disorders. A patient of East Asian descent with type 2
diabetes does not have an increased risk for liver disease or thyroid disorders.

p. 375
Question 73

Which statement is correct regarding potential complications of poorly controlled

gestational diabetes?

x) © "If | do not follow the treatment plan, | could have a miscarriage."
O "If | do not follow the treatment plan, my baby could have trouble gaining weight."
O "If | do not follow the treatment plan, my baby could have a low birth weight."

rv) O "If | do not follow the treatment plan, my baby could be born with a larger body size than normal."

So close!

Rationale

The most common outcome for an infant born to a mother with gestational diabetes is macrosomia, a larger-
than-normal body size. Miscarriages are a complication related to bulimia nervosa in the mother. Difficulty
gaining weight and having a low birth weight are common conditions of infants born to mothers with bulimia

nervosa.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

Question 74

A pregnant patient diagnosed with gestational diabetes is receiving information on
maintaining a balanced diet throughout the pregnancy. The patient’s recommended body

weight for pregnancy is 90 kg (198 Ib). What is this patient’s recommended daily protein
intake?

That's right!

Rationale

The recommended daily protein intake for a patient with gestational diabetes with a recommended body
weight of 90 kg for pregnancy is 1.1 g of protein per kilogram of recommended body weight, which equals 99
g of daily protein for this patient. Intakes of 72 g and 90 g are too low. An intake of 108 g is too high.

p. 384
Question 75

Which sign or symptom do patients with type 1 diabetes often experience? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Weight loss

rv) m| Polyphagia
rv) | Polyuria

Decrease in appetite

Weight gain

ncontinence

That's right!

Rationale

Cells use glucose for energy; without endogenous insulin, cells begin to starve. The body responds by sending
signals to eat because cells are hungry. Because the end product of digestion (glucose) cannot enter cells,
glucose builds up in the bloodstream. It is common for the patient with type 1 diabetes to experience weight
loss despite consuming large quantities of food (polyphagia). Because glucose cannot enter cells and builds
up in the bloodstream, blood becomes hypertonic, and the body tries to get rid of the excess glucose by
increasing urine output (polyuria). In reaction to increased excretion of urine, the body again responds by
increasing thirst (polydipsia) to replace lost fluids. Because of this, the patient with type 1 diabetes experiences
an increase in appetite and weight loss (not weight gain). Even though patients will have an increase in urine

output, they will not experience incontinence related to type 1 diabetes.

p. 371
Question 76

Teaching about carbohydrate counting has been effective when the prediabetic patient

makes which statement?

x) © "One carbohydrate serving equals 10 g of carbohydrates."
O "Half a cup of dried fruit is one serving of carbohydrates."
O “If ’'m counting carbohydrates, | no longer need insulin."

rv) O "One cup of milk is equal to one carbohydrate serving."

So close!

Rationale

One cup of milk is equal to one carbohydrate serving. One carbohydrate serving equals 15 g of carbohydrates.
A quarter cup of dried fruit is one serving of carbohydrates. Patients may still require insulin when counting

carbohydrates.

p. 385
Question 77

In the United States, gestational diabetes accounts for what percentage of all pregnancies

annually?
OC 1%
00%
Q 10%
OQ 13%

That's right!

Rationale

The prevalence of gestational diabetes in the United States is approximately 7% of all pregnancies annually.
Gestational diabetes does not account for 1%, 10%, or 13% of all pregnancies annually in the United States.

pp. 368-369
Question 78

Chronic kidney disease and renal failure requiring dialysis develop in approximately what

percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes?

That's right!

Rationale

Microvascular effects of type 1 diabetes include nephropathy and retinopathy. As a result of nephropathy,
chronic kidney disease and renal failure requiring dialysis develop in approximately 50% of all individuals with
type 1 diabetes. The percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes who develop chronic kidney disease and renal
failure is more than 5% and more than 20% but less than 80%.

p. 375
Question 79

Genetic predisposition and environmental factors are common with which type of diabetes?

@ ©@ Type 1 diabetes

© Type 2 diabetes
O Gestational diabetes
O Prediabetes

That's right!

Rationale

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting in the destruction of beta cells. Genetic predisposition
and environmental factors are involved. One or more autoantibodies are present in the majority of individuals
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is an insidious disease; it is not uncommon for a person to
have type 2 diabetes years before diagnosis. Occasionally, the stress of pregnancy may induce gestational
diabetes. This is a form of glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy only. Prediabetes occurs before
type 2 diabetes.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very

cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and an absolute may be a
reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a guideline and should not be taken

to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number of choices.

pp. 366-367
Question 80

When should patients to be tested for gestational diabetes?
O Postpartum

O First trimester

O Third trimester

Cy) © Second trimester

That's right!

Rationale

All women should undergo screening for gestational diabetes during the second trimester because
gestational diabetes occurs most commonly after 20 weeks of gestation. Women should not be initially tested
for gestational diabetes during the postpartum period because this is too late. The first trimester is too early,
and the third trimester is too late.

pp. 368-369
Question 81

Why is exercise important for a patient with type 2 diabetes who is already maintaining a
healthy weight?
x) © To potentiate the activation of insulin
O To decrease the effects of glucose
rv) O To improve cellular uptake of glucose

O To promote a negative energy balance

So close!

Rationale

Exercise is important for a patient with type 2 diabetes who is already maintaining a healthy weight because it
improves cellular uptake of glucose. Exercise does not potentiate the activation of insulin or decrease the
effects of glucose. Exercise requires energy, which is supplied by glucose; therefore exercise lowers the glucose

level, not the effect of glucose. A patient who is not overweight does not need a negative energy balance.

p. 378
Question 82

Which factor must be considered when implementing medical nutrition therapy for a
patient with type 2 diabetes? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Age

Physical activity

That's right!

Rationale

Patient food preferences, metabolic goals, meal schedules, and physical activity should be considered when
implementing medical nutrition therapy for a patient with type 2 diabetes. Age must be considered only if it
affects one of the other factors.

Question 1
Es

Which term describes dilute urine that presents during the early stages of chronic kidney

disease?

O Ketonuria

That's right!

Rationale

During the early stages of chronic kidney failure, the kidneys are unable to reabsorb water or properly
concentrate urine. Therefore large amounts of dilute urine are produced, called polyuria. As the disease
progresses, urine production declines. Anuria occurs when there is no urine output and oliguria when there

are abnormally small amounts of it. Ketonuria is the presence of ketone bodies in the urine.

p. 399
Question 2

Which findings in the patient with chronic kidney disease are described by the term
azotemia?

O Production of large amounts of dilute urine
x) © Protein-energy malnutrition as a result of protein catabolism
O Accumulation of phosphate, sulfate, and organic acids in the blood

rv) O Elevated blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid levels

So close!

Rationale

Azotemia describes elevated blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid levels. Polyuria is the
production of large amounts of dilute urine. Protein-energy malnutrition is a common complication of
protein catabolism in patients with chronic kidney disease. Metabolic acidosis is caused by the accumulation
of phosphate, sulfate, and organic acids in the blood.

Test-Taking Tip: Sometimes the reading of a question in the middle or toward the end of an exam may trigger
your mind with the answer or provide an important clue to an earlier question.

p. 399
Question 3

How does glomerular filtration rate change as chronic kidney disease progresses?

O Glomerular filtration rate increases.
Cy) © Glomerular filtration rate decreases.
© Glomerular filtration rate stays the same.

© Glomerular filtration rate initially increases, then decreases rapidly.

That's right!

Rationale

As chronic kidney disease progresses, glomerular filtration rate decreases. It does not increase, stay the same,

or initially increase and then decrease rapidly.

p. 399
Question 4

Which term describes the process of removing waste and excess fluid from the blood?

That's right!

Rationale

Dialysis is the process of removing waste and fluid from the blood when the kidneys are unable to do so.
Anuria describes the failure of the kidneys to produce urine. Diuresis describes increased urine output.
Oliguria describes low urine output.

p. 392
Question 5

Which term describes the failure of the kidneys to produce urine?

Cy) © Anuria

That's right!

Rationale

Anuria describes the failure of the kidneys to produce urine. Oliguria describes low urine output. Diuresis
describes increased urine output. Dialysis is the clinical purification of the blood when the kidneys are unable

to do so.

p. 396
Question 6

Which term describes low urine output?

That's right!

Rationale
Oliguria describes low urine output. Anuria describes the failure of the kidneys to produce urine. Dialysis is

the clinical purification of the blood when the kidneys are unable to do so. Diuresis describes increased urine

output.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five

consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p. 396
Question 7

Which cause of acute kidney injury is categorized as postrenal obstruction?
© Severe dehydration

© Interstitial nephritis

© Systemic vasodilation

@ ©@ Prostatic hypertrophy

That's right!

Rationale

Prostatic hypertrophy with urinary retention is a common cause of postrenal obstruction acute kidney injury.
Severe dehydration is a cause of prerenal acute kidney injury. Interstitial nephritis is a common cause of

intrinsic acute kidney injury. Like severe dehydration, systemic vasodilation can cause prerenal acute kidney
injury.

p. 397
Question &

Which cause of acute kidney injury is categorized as intrinsic?

© Severe dehydration
@ ©@ Interstitial nephritis
© Systemic vasodilation

©) Prostatic hypertrophy

That's right!

Rationale
Intrinsic acute kidney injury results from damage to a specific part of the kidney; interstitial nephritis can
cause this. Severe dehydration and systemic vasodilation are causes of prerenal acute kidney injury. Prostatic

hypertrophy with urinary retention is a common cause of postrenal obstruction acute kidney injury.

p. 397
Question 9

If hypertension and edema are present in the patient with chronic kidney disease, what is

the recommended limit for sodium intake?
O 1 g/day

rv) © 2 g/day
O 3 g/day
O 4 g/day

That's right!

Rationale

If hypertension and edema are present in the patient with chronic kidney disease, sodium intake should be
limited to 2 g/day. Intake of only 1 g/day may not meet sodium requirements. Intake of 3 g/day or 4 g/day is
too high.

p. 400
Question 10

Which criteria are used in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury?

© ©@ Increased serum blood urea nitrogen levels and anuria
©) Decreased serum blood urea nitrogen levels and diuresis
@ © Increased serum creatinine levels and oliguria

O Decreased serum creatinine levels and diuresis

So close!

Rationale
The diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury are increased serum creatinine levels and oliguria, which is
caused when cellular debris from tissue damage blocks the tubules. Increased serum blood urea nitrogen

levels, anuria, decreased serum blood urea nitrogen levels, diuresis, and decreased serum creatinine levels are
not diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 397
Question 11

During which phase of acute kidney injury do losses of sodium and potassium need to be

replaced?

That's right!

Rationale

During the diuretic phase, patients may lose excessive electrolytes. Losses of both sodium and potassium (2 to
3 g/day of each) should be replaced during this phase. During anuria or oliguria, electrolytes may need to be
restricted due to accumulation in the blood and increased risk for hyperkalemia. During recovery, kidney

function gradually improves, and intake of nutrients may normalize.

p. 398
Question 12

Which macronutrient should be restricted in patients with acute kidney injury?

© Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale
Protein should be restricted in patients with acute kidney injury. Fat should not be restricted. Fiber is not a

macronutrient and should not be restricted. Carbohydrates should not be restricted.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Rely on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this,
read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based
on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of
the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

p. 398
Question 13

In chronic kidney disease, which metabolic condition is the result of the kidney’s inability to

properly filter materials and their buildup in the blood?

O Ketosis
rv) © Acidosis

O Ketoacidosis

That's right!

Rationale

In chronic kidney disease, a concentration of materials (e.g., phosphate, sulfate, organic acids) is produced by
the metabolism of nutrients. Without appropriate filtering by the failing kidneys, these materials accumulate
in the blood, thereby causing metabolic acidosis. Ketosis, alkalosis, and ketoacidosis occur as a result of

different imbalances.

p. 399
Question 14

Which condition marked by an alteration in bone morphology is found in patients with

chronic kidney disease?
O Osteopenia

x) © Osteoporosis

O Osteomyelitis

rv) O Osteodystrophy

So close!

Rationale

Osteodystrophy is an alteration of bone morphology found in patients with chronic kidney disease.
Osteopenia occurs when the body makes new bone at a slower rate than it reabsorbs old bone. Osteoporosis

is a condition of weak and brittle bones. Osteomyelitis is inflammation of bone caused by infection.

p. 399
Question 15

Which conditions are the most common causes of chronic kidney disease?

© Obesity and anemia
© Lupus and hyperlipidemia
© Glomerulonephritis and hepatitis

@ ©@ Diabetic nephropathy and hypertension

That's right!

Rationale

The most common causes of chronic kidney disease are diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. Obesity,
anemia, lupus, hyperlipidemia, glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis are not typically common causes of chronic
kidney disease.

p. 399
Question 16

Which term describes the removal of certain elements from the blood according to their

rates of diffusion through a semipermeable membrane?

rv) © Hemodialysis

O Glomerular filtration
O Immune complex deposition

O Antigen-antibody complex formation

That's right!

Rationale

Hemodialysis is the removal of certain elements from the blood according to their rates of diffusion through
a semipermeable membrane. Glomerular filtration is the rate at which substances are cleared from the plasma
by the glomerulus. Immune complex deposition and antigen-antibody complex formation occur in

nondiabetic glomerular diseases and do not involve filtration.

p. 402
Question 17

Which health care provider is responsible for evaluating laboratory assessments and

determining current versus ideal nutrient intake in the patient with chronic kidney disease?
O Urologist

O Nephrologist

rv) © Renal dietitian

O Registered nurse

That's right!

Rationale

The renal dietitian is responsible for evaluating laboratory assessments and determining current versus ideal
nutrient intake in the patient with chronic kidney disease. The urologist, nephrologist, and registered nurse
play other roles in the care of the patient with chronic kidney disease.

p. 395
Question 18

Which condition may result from the diminished ability of failing kidneys to synthesize

adequate amounts of erythropoietin in the patient with chronic kidney disease?

rv) © Anemia

O Diabetes

O Hypertension
O Hyperlipidemia

That's right!

Rationale

Because of the diminished ability of failing kidneys to synthesize adequate amounts of erythropoietin, most
patients with chronic renal failure develop anemia if left untreated. Diabetes, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia are not results of inadequate amounts of erythropoietin.

p. 399
Question 19

Which statement regarding nutrition for patients with chronic kidney disease is incorrect?

©) Dietary guidelines should be adapted as needed for individual patient requirements.
© Fluid intake does not typically require restriction if balanced with output.
@ © A protein-restricted diet can still provide the full daily requirement of all essential nutrients.

© ©@ Most animal sources of protein have a higher biological value and are preferred over most plant-
based sources for patients.

So close!

Rationale

The statement requiring correction is "A protein-restricted diet can still provide the full daily requirement of
all essential nutrients." A protein-restricted diet does not contribute the full daily requirement of all essential
nutrients and usually requires supplementation. It is true that dietary guidelines should be adapted as needed
for individual patient requirements, fluid intake does not typically require restriction if balanced with output,

and most animal sources of protein have a higher biological value and are preferred over most plant-based

sources.

p. 400
Question 20

Which statement explains the occurrence of oliguria in the patient with acute kidney injury?

© Accumulated uremic toxins not completely removed by dialysis
©) Diminished ability of failing kidneys to synthesize adequate amounts of erythropoietin

©) Decreased ability of kidneys to excrete potassium in an amount equal to that absorbed by the
gastrointestinal tract

@ @ Blockage of tubules caused by cellular debris from tissue trauma or urinary failure with backup
retention of filtrate materials

That's right!

Rationale

Blockage of tubules caused by cellular debris from tissue trauma or urinary failure with backup retention of
filtrate materials explains the occurrence of oliguria in the patient with acute kidney injury. Accumulation of
uremic toxins not completely removed by dialysis is a cause of uremia in the acute kidney injury patient.
Diminished ability of failing kidneys to synthesize adequate amounts of erythropoietin often leads to anemia
in the acute kidney injury patient. Decreased ability of kidneys to excrete potassium in an amount equal to

that absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract leads to excessive potassium levels.

p. 397
Question 21

When assessing the dietary intake of a patient with chronic kidney disease, what

information should the nurse obtain?

O Current dietary intake only
O Previous dietary intake only
rv) © Previous and current dietary intake

O Dietary intake information is not relevant

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse should obtain qualitative and quantitative information about both previous and current dietary
intakes. Previous dietary intake information is highly relevant for assessing nutrition status, as is current
dietary intake.

Test-Taking Tip: Because few things in life are absolute without exceptions, avoid selecting answers that

include words such as always, never, all, every, and none. Answers containing these key words are rarely correct.

p. 400
Question 22

Which diagnostic marker determines the stage of chronic kidney disease?

© Urinary albumin
O Serum creatinine
© Blood urea nitrogen
Cy) © Glomerular filtration rate

That's right!

Rationale
Glomerular filtration rate determines the stage of chronic kidney disease. Urinary albumin, serum creatinine,
and blood urea nitrogen are important for the health care provider to monitor in the patient with chronic

kidney disease, but they are not diagnostic markers for the stage of chronic kidney disease.

p. 399
Question 23

Which statement about chronic kidney disease is incorrect?

© Renal transplantation is one type of renal replacement treatment.
© Chronic kidney disease may result from congenital birth defects of the kidneys and urinary tract.
@ ©@ Loss of kidney function is reversible if the patient follows the treatment protocol.

© Once chronic kidney disease progresses to end-stage renal disease, treatment focuses on reducing
uremia.

That's right!

Rationale

Loss of kidney function is not reversible. Chronic kidney disease involves progressive, irreversible loss of
kidney function over days, months, or years. It is true that renal transplantation is one type of renal
replacement treatment, that chronic kidney disease may result from congenital birth defects of the kidneys

and urinary tract, and that end-stage renal disease treatment focuses on reducing uremia.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words, (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks, and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 398
Question 24

Which cause of acute kidney injury is due decreased blood supply?

O Uremia

O Nephrosclerosis

© ©@ Glomerulonephritis

Cy) O Renal occlusion

So close!

Rationale

A common cause of acute kidney injury is renal occlusion, which results in decreased blood supply and
subsequent reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Uremia is a symptom of kidney disease marked by
excessive amounts of urea and other nitrogenous waste products in the blood. Nephrosclerosis is necrosis of
the renal arterioles from hypertension, which is a cause of chronic kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is acute

inflammation of the kidneys, often caused by an immune response.

p. 397
Question 25

Which goal would be included in the plan of care for a patient newly diagnosed with

nephrotic syndrome? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Control the major symptoms.

Decrease the risk of atherosclerosis.

Decrease the glomerular filtration rate.

| Stop the progression to chronic kidney disease.

Cy) Replace nutrients that are lost in the urine.

So close!

Rationale

Nephrotic syndrome results from nephron tissue damage to the major filtering membrane of the glomeruli,
thereby allowing protein to pass into the tubule. This high protein concentration may cause further damage to
the tubule. The goals of medical nutrition therapy for nephrotic syndrome are to control the major symptoms,
replace nutrients lost in the urine, reduce the progression to chronic kidney disease, and decrease the risk of
atherosclerosis. The higher the glomerular filtration rate the better, so a decrease in the glomerular filtration

rate would not be a goal of therapy.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 396
Question 26

Which factors contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

m| Use of IV contrast dye

Prostatic hypertrophy

Aminoglycoside antibiotic use

Consumption of heavy metals

Recurrent urinary tract infections

That's right!

Rationale

Several disease conditions may interfere with the normal functioning of the nephron and eventually result in
kidney disease. Infections, including urinary tract infections, can lead to chronic disease and formation of
kidney stones. Other causes of obstruction, such as prostatic hypertrophy, which blocks urinary tract drainage,
may lead to general tissue damage and kidney disease. Various environmental agents, animal venom, certain
plants, heavy metals, and some drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycoside

antibiotics, and radiographic contrast dye, are nephrotoxic and can cause kidney damage.

p. 394
Question 27

Which laboratory marker is an indication of kidney function?
© Hemoglobin

O Prothrombin time
Cy) © Glomerular filtration rate

O Aspartate aminotransferase

That's right!

Rationale

Glomerular filtration rate is the rate at which glomeruli filter blood. This is the current method of monitoring
kidney function and defining stages of kidney disease. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries
oxygen and is measured in a complete blood count. Prothrombin time is a blood test that measures how long
it takes for blood to clot. Aspartate aminotransferase is used to detect liver damage.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,
read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 392
Question 28

Which part of the body is negatively affected by inappropriate blood phosphorous and

calcium levels in the patient with chronic kidney disease?

rv) © Bone

That's right!

Rationale

Inappropriate blood phosphorus and calcium levels negatively affect bone composition. They do not directly
affect the brain, heart, or muscle.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Rely on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this,
read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based
on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of
the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly
answering each question.

p. 400
Question 29

Chronic kidney disease interferes with the conversion of which vitamin to its active form?
O Vitamin A

Cy) © Vitamin D
O Vitamin K
O Vitamin E

That's right!

Rationale
Chronic kidney disease interferes with the conversion of vitamin D to its active form. Vitamin A can
accumulate to toxic levels in the patient with chronic kidney disease. Vitamin K can interfere with clotting.

Vitamin E can accumulate to toxic levels in the patient with chronic kidney disease.

p. 399
Question 30

Which patient is at risk of developing struvite kidney stones?
© Amale patient who is diagnosed with gout and is obese

© Amale patient who is obese and has a history of inflammatory bowel disease
© A female patient recently diagnosed with diabetes who consumes a low-calcium diet

@ ©@ A female patient who has experienced frequent urinary tract infections during her life

That's right!

Rationale

Struvite kidney stones are also referred to as infection stones. The patient with the history of urinary tract
infections would be most at risk of developing struvite stones since these types of stones are primarily caused
by urinary tract infections and not associated with any nutrient. The patient who is obese and has a diagnosis
of gout would be most at risk for developing uric acid stones. The patient who is obese with a history of
inflammatory bowel disease would be most at risk for cystine stones. The patient who has diabetes and

consumes a diet low in calcium would be most at risk for developing calcium stones.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

pp. 408-409
Question 31

Which assessment information is a risk factor for acute kidney injury? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.
Obesity

rv) mw] Diabetes
rv) m| Advanced age

Diuretic medication use

rv) m| Nephrotoxic medication use

That's right!

Rationale

Baseline risk factors for the development of acute kidney injury include diabetes, advanced age, and
underlying renal insufficiency attributable to systemic infection, organ failure, or the use of nephrotoxic
medications. Obesity and diuretic medication use are not recognized as risk factors for acute kidney injury.

p. 397
Question 32

Recommended total fluid intake for the patient with acute kidney injury will depend on

which factor? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Height
Cy) | Fluid status

Body weight

Cy) Sodium status

@ |B] Degree of residual renal function

So close!

Rationale

Total fluid intake for the patient with acute kidney injury depends on fluid and sodium status as well as the
degree of residual renal function. Height and weight are not used to determine recommended total fluid
intake.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 398
Question 33

Which teaching would the nurse provide a patient with a frequent history of calcium stones

about foods to avoid?
x) © "You need to avoid foods with calcium."

O "You should limit your intake of cheese."
rv) O "You need to avoid dark, leafy, green vegetables."
O "You should limit your fluid intake to 1 L of fluid per day."

So close!

Rationale

Foods that are high in oxalate content increase the risk of calcium stones. Foods with high oxalate content
include dark, green and leafy vegetables, beans, beets, potatoes, bran products, tea, cocoa, and some nuts. An
adequate dietary calcium intake will help to prevent the development of calcium oxalate stone formation.
Cheese is rich in calcium and should be consumed. Drinking an adequate amount of fluids will help to
prevent calcium stone formation.

p. 408
Question 34

Which statement about the pathophysiology of uric stone formation is accurate?

©) Uric acid stones are the result of a genetic defect.
©) Uric acid stones are the result of urinary tract infections.
@ ©@ Uric acid stones may result from an impairment in purine metabolism.

© Uric acid stones result from the supersaturation of kidney stone material in the urine.

That's right!

Rationale

The primary risk factors for uric acid stone formation is acidic urine, excess urinary excretion of uric acid, and
low urine volume. Hyperuricosuria may result from an impairment in purine metabolism. Purine is a nitrogen
product of protein metabolism and forms uric acid. Cystine stones are the result of a genetic defect in the
renal reabsorption process of the amino acid cystine. Struvite stones, also called infection stones, are primarily
caused by urinary tract infections. Calcium stones occur from the supersaturation of kidney stone material in
the urine.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices
will seem like the correct response.

pp. 408-409
Question 35

Which teaching would the nurse include when educating a patient about why nutrition is
important in the prevention of kidney stones? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

| "Vitamin C intake should not exceed the dietary reference intake."

“Avoid unnecessary intake of high-oxalate foods."

"Fluid intake should be at least 2 to 3 L every day.”

"Calcium intake should be between 1000 and 1200 mg/day."

"Weight loss is recommended, as obesity will increase your risk."

That's right!

Rationale

General medical nutrition therapy for nephrolithiasis includes a calcium intake between 1000 and 1200
mg/day, fluid intake of at least 2 to 3 L per day, weight loss if the patient is obese, adequate vitamin C intake
but not exceeding the dietary reference intake, and avoiding any unnecessary intake of high-oxalate foods.
Limiting dietary oxalates reduces urinary oxalate excretion and the risk of stone formation.

p. 409
Question 36

Which response would the nurse provide a patient with a history of frequent nephrolithiasis
who is asking how to prevent future occurrences?

O "You should consume a low-potassium diet."
O "Make sure you are consuming a diet high in sodium."
x) © ‘A diet high in protein will help to prevent kidney stones."

rv) O "A low-calcium diet will increase your risk of kidney stones."

So close!

Rationale

Nephrolithiasis is the medical term for kidney stones. Low dietary calcium intake is a risk for calcium oxalate
stone formation. The patient should be encouraged to consume 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day and
balance their intake throughout the day. Citrate and potassium are helpful in solubilizing calcium salts and
preventing stone formation. Patients should be encouraged to consume 4.7 g of potassium per day. High
sodium intake increases the amount of calcium excretion in the urine, thereby increasing the risk for stone

formation. Excessive protein intake from animal sources is a risk factor for stone formation.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

pp. 408-409
Question 37

Which response would the nurse provide to support the nutrition status of a patient who
recently started dialysis?
O "You should be consuming very little protein."

rv) © "You should not exceed 2 g of calcium per day."
O "You should limit your sodium intake to 3 g/day.”

O "You do not need to worry about your potassium intake."

That's right!

Rationale

The diet of a patient receiving hemodialysis is important for maintaining biochemical balance. Calcium intake
should not exceed 2 g/day, including the amount received through food, dietary supplements, and
medications. Protein-energy malnutrition is a major concern for people on hemodialysis. For most people on
dialysis, a protein allowance of at least 1.2 g/kg is ideal to prevent protein malnutrition. It is recommended to
limit sodium intake to 2.4 g/day, not 3 g/day, to control body fluid retention and hypertension. To prevent
potassium accumulation, which can cause cardiac problems, potassium intake should be limited to less than
2.4 g/day.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be very helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best
choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which
one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 403
Question 38

A patient develops acute kidney injury while admitted to the hospital for community-
acquired pneumonia. Which action would the nurse take if the patient has been prescribed

peritoneal dialysis?

© Secure the vascular access site.
@ © Educate the patient about how to perform peritoneal dialysis.
© Inform the patient that they cannot move during this type of dialysis.

© ©@ Inform the patient that peritoneal dialysis lasts approximately 4 hours.

So close!

Rationale

Peritoneal dialysis is a form of dialysis where the peritoneal membrane serves as a filter in which metabolic
wastes can pass into the dialysate for removal from the body. The nurse would educate the patient on how to
perform peritoneal dialysis as the patient introduces the dialysate solution directly into the peritoneal cavity.
The access for peritoneal dialysis is a permanent catheter in the peritoneal cavity, not a vascular access as with
hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis allows for mobility. Hemodialysis typically is required three times per week
and lasts about 3 to 4 hours.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

pp. 403-404
Question 39

Which descriptor is a cause-based category of acute kidney injury? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Diuretic

Oliguric

@| Intrinsic

Prerenal

| Postrenal obstruction

That's right!

Rationale

Depending on the underlying cause, acute kidney injury is divided into three categories: intrinsic, prerenal,
and postrenal obstruction. Diuretic and oliguric are phases, not causes, of acute kidney injury.

p. 397
Question 40

Which nutrient may be restricted in patients with acute kidney injury? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

lron

@| Protein

| Calcium

| Sodium

Potassium

m| Phosphorus

So close!

Rationale

In patients with acute kidney injury, protein, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus may be restricted. Iron and
calcium may be depleted in protein-restricted diets and may require supplementation.

p. 398
Question 41

Which condition is a long-term complication of chronic kidney disease? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) m| Anemia

Diabetes

Malnutrition

Metabolic syndrome

iV]
Cy) | Bone disorders
iv)

m| Cardiovascular disease

So close!

Rationale

Long-term complications of chronic kidney disease include anemia, malnutrition, bone disorders, and
cardiovascular disease. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome are risk factors for chronic kidney disease, not

complications of it.

p. 399
Question 42

What effect can nutritional therapy have on the outcomes of patients with chronic kidney

disease? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] M™| Prevent wasting

x) | Prevent weight gain

rv] m| Prevent malnutrition

rv] ®| Minimize uremic toxicity

rv] m| Delay renal disease progression
So close!

Rationale

Nutrition therapy in the patient with chronic kidney disease can prevent wasting and malnutrition, minimize
uremic toxicity, and delay progression of renal disease. Prevention of weight gain is not a goal in chronic
kidney disease, the patient already being in a catabolic state.

Question 43

Which food should be restricted during the oliguric phase of acute kidney injury? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) ™| Banana

Broccoli

Cucumber

| Cantaloupe

vd
tx} | Asparagus
vd

So close!

Rationale

During the oliguric phase, potassium may be restricted to 1000 mg per day. Banana, broccoli, and cantaloupe
are high in potassium. Asparagus and cucumber are low in potassium and safe to consume during this phase.

p. 398
Question 44

Place in the correct order the process of tubular secretion and reabsorption.

tx} 1. The remaining 20% of fluid enters the loop of Henle.

tx} 2. Secretion of hydrogen ions occurs to control the acid-base

balance.

tx} 3. Reabsorption of glucose and amino acids, along with water,

occurs.

rv) 4. Concentrated urine is produced.

So close!

Rationale

A small tubule carries the filtered fluid from Bowman’s capsule through its winding pathway and empties into
the central area of the kidney medulla. The four sections of the tubular component reabsorb and secrete
specific substances starting with the proximal tubule, a brush border membrane containing thousands of
microvilli that greatly increase the surface area of the first section. This section usually reabsorbs glucose and
amino acids. Next, the remaining 20% of fluid enters the loop of Henle. Next, the secretion of hydrogen ions
occurs as needed in the distal tubule to control the acid-base balance. Lastly, concentrated urine is produced
in the collecting tubule section.

p. 393
Question 45

A patient with acute kidney injury has a 24-hour urine output of 400 mL. What is the

recommended fluid intake for this patient? Record your answer using a whole number.

@| 500 @| 900 | mt

So close!

Rationale

In general, recommended fluid intake can be calculated by adding 500 mL (for insensible losses) to the 24-
hour urine output. 400 mL + 500 mL = 900 mL.

p. 398
Question 46

Which nutrition recommendation is appropriate for a patient who has progressed to stage 5
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and will begin renal replacement therapy (RRT)?
rv) O Sodium should be restricted to less than 2.4 g/day.

O The saturated fat intake would be the same as that recommended for the general population.
x) © Protein intake should not exceed 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day.

O Potassium intake would only be restricted based on serum potassium level.

So close!

Rationale

CKD is staged by disease severity, and treatment should be based on the level of progression. In a patient with
stage 5 CKD, sodium should be restricted to <2.4 g/day to control interdialytic fluid gain. In stage 5 CKD, the
patient receiving RRT would reduce and substitute saturated fat with healthier fat sources. When a patient is
receiving RRT, protein intake should be 1.1 to 1.5 g/kg of body weight per day. If the patient had stage 5 CKD
but was not receiving RRT, the protein intake recommendation would be 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg of body weight per
day. If the patient is receiving hemodialysis, potassium intake should be 2 to 4 g/day, or 40 mg/kg of body
weight per day. Potassium intake would only be restricted based on serum potassium laboratory test values in
patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD who are not receiving RRT.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly, because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

pp. 399-400, 407
Question 47

Which patient is at greatest risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD)?
© A 65-year-old patient who is obese and trying to quit smoking.

© A59-year-old patient diagnosed with lupus who runs 5 miles every day.

@ ©@ A61-year-old patient with a history of diabetes and long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) use.

© A55-year old patient who recently had kidney stones and has a normal body mass index (BM).

That's right!

Rationale

CKD is a progressive breakdown of kidney tissue, which impairs all kidney functions. Individuals older than 60
years have the highest prevalence of CKD. The patient who has a history of diabetes and with long-term
NSAID use would be at highest risk. Metabolic diseases with kidney involvement, including diabetes,
hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic syndrome, and obesity increases a patient’s risk of
CKD. Other causes of CKD are the long-term use of nephrotoxic substances, including NSAIDs. The patient
who is trying to quit smoking is lowering their risk. Lupus does increase the risk of CKD, but the patient is
physically active, which helps to decrease the risk. Kidney stones increase the risk of CKD, but a normal BMI
will help lower the risk.

p. 398
Question 48

The patient with chronic kidney disease has a glomerular filtration rate of 27 mL/min/1.73
m “and a body weight of 180 Ib. The patient is not receiving dialysis. How much protein

should the patient consume daily?

x HO) 16 to 22 g
iv @) 49 to 66 g

O 82 to 106 g
© 108 to 144g

So close!

Rationale

Protein is generally limited to 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg daily for individuals who are not receiving dialysis and have a
glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. To find protein intake requirements, the nurse
converts the patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms (180/2.2 = 82) and multiplies by the protein cofactors (82
x 0.6 = 49 and 82 x 0.8 = 66). The patient should consume 49 to 66 g of protein daily. Daily protein intake of
16 to 22 g would not be enough for this patient to maintain tissue integrity, while daily protein intakes of 82
to 106 g or 108 to 144 g would be excessive for this patient.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 400
Question 49

A patient is recovering in the hospital after kidney transplantation. At patient discharge,
which teaching would the nurse provide when discussing side effects of corticosteroids?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| "You may notice that you retain some fluid.”

"You may notice that your appetite is increased."

a
| “Long-term corticosteroid use can affect your heart."
a

"Corticosteroids can cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract."

"You can become hypoglycemic, which would require medical attention."

That's right!

Rationale

Most kidney transplant recipients undergo multidrug immunosuppressive therapy that includes
corticosteroids to reduce the risk of acute rejection. Corticosteroid use is associated with a number of adverse
effects that specifically alter overall nutrition status, including fluid retention, increased appetite and
unintentional weight gain, cardiovascular disease and mortality, and gastrointestinal irritation. A side effect of

corticosteroid use is hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia.

p. 405
Question 50

Which intervention would the nurse use to support the nutrition of patients with acute

kidney injury? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Assess for diarrhea.

Cy) Assess for constipation.

@ |B] Monitor fluid intake and output.

Encourage patients to consume a high-protein diet.

@ |B] Coordinate patient education with the renal dietitian.

So close!

Rationale

The nurse should assess the patient with acute kidney injury for constipation resulting from restricted intake
of fluid and fresh fruits. The nurse should closely monitor fluid intake and output. The nurse should
coordinate patient and family education with the renal dietitian. Constipation is more likely than diarrhea in

the patient with acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury requires a protein-restricted diet.

p. 398
Question 51

Recommended total fluid intake for the patient with acute kidney injury will depend on

which factor? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Height

rv) | Fluid status

Body weight

rv) m| Sodium status

rv) m| Degree of residual renal function

That's right!

Rationale

Total fluid intake for the patient with acute kidney injury depends on fluid and sodium status as well as the
degree of residual renal function. Height and weight are not used to determine recommended total fluid

intake.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 398
Question 52

Which teaching would the nurse provide a patient with a frequent history of calcium stones

about foods to avoid?

O "You need to avoid foods with calcium."
O "You should limit your intake of cheese."
rv) © "You need to avoid dark, leafy, green vegetables."
O "You should limit your fluid intake to 1 L of fluid per day."

That's right!

Rationale

Foods that are high in oxalate content increase the risk of calcium stones. Foods with high oxalate content
include dark, green and leafy vegetables, beans, beets, potatoes, bran products, tea, cocoa, and some nuts. An
adequate dietary calcium intake will help to prevent the development of calcium oxalate stone formation.
Cheese is rich in calcium and should be consumed. Drinking an adequate amount of fluids will help to
prevent calcium stone formation.

p. 408
Question 53

Which response would the nurse provide a patient with a history of frequent nephrolithiasis

who is asking how to prevent future occurrences?

O "You should consume a low-potassium diet."
O "Make sure you are consuming a diet high in sodium."
O ‘A diet high in protein will help to prevent kidney stones."

rv) © "A low-calcium diet will increase your risk of kidney stones."

That's right!

Rationale

Nephrolithiasis is the medical term for kidney stones. Low dietary calcium intake is a risk for calcium oxalate
stone formation. The patient should be encouraged to consume 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day and
balance their intake throughout the day. Citrate and potassium are helpful in solubilizing calcium salts and
preventing stone formation. Patients should be encouraged to consume 4.7 g of potassium per day. High
sodium intake increases the amount of calcium excretion in the urine, thereby increasing the risk for stone

formation. Excessive protein intake from animal sources is a risk factor for stone formation.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

pp. 408-409
Question 54

A patient develops acute kidney injury while admitted to the hospital for community-
acquired pneumonia. Which action would the nurse take if the patient has been prescribed

peritoneal dialysis?

© Secure the vascular access site.
@ ©@ Educate the patient about how to perform peritoneal dialysis.
© Inform the patient that they cannot move during this type of dialysis.

© Inform the patient that peritoneal dialysis lasts approximately 4 hours.

That's right!

Rationale

Peritoneal dialysis is a form of dialysis where the peritoneal membrane serves as a filter in which metabolic
wastes can pass into the dialysate for removal from the body. The nurse would educate the patient on how to
perform peritoneal dialysis as the patient introduces the dialysate solution directly into the peritoneal cavity.
The access for peritoneal dialysis is a permanent catheter in the peritoneal cavity, not a vascular access as with
hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis allows for mobility. Hemodialysis typically is required three times per week

and lasts about 3 to 4 hours.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

pp. 403-404
Question 55

Which nutrient may be restricted in patients with acute kidney injury? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

lron

rv) | Protein

Calcium

mw! Sodium

Potassium

m| Phosphorus

That's right!

Rationale

In patients with acute kidney injury, protein, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus may be restricted. Iron and
calcium may be depleted in protein-restricted diets and may require supplementation.

p. 398
Question 56

Which condition is a long-term complication of chronic kidney disease? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Anemia

Diabetes

mw! Malnutrition

Metabolic syndrome

m| Cardiovascular disease

rv) mw] Bone disorders

That's right!

Rationale

Long-term complications of chronic kidney disease include anemia, malnutrition, bone disorders, and
cardiovascular disease. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome are risk factors for chronic kidney disease, not
complications of it.

p. 399
Question 57

What effect can nutritional therapy have on the outcomes of patients with chronic kidney

disease? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) M™| Prevent wasting

Question 60

A patient with acute kidney injury has a 24-hour urine output of 400 mL. What is the

recommended fluid intake for this patient? Record your answer using a whole number.

@) 900 =m

That's right!

Rationale

In general, recommended fluid intake can be calculated by adding 500 mL (for insensible losses) to the 24-
hour urine output. 400 mL + 500 mL = 900 mL.

p. 398
Question 61

Which nutrition recommendation is appropriate for a patient who has progressed to stage 5
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and will begin renal replacement therapy (RRT)?
rv) O Sodium should be restricted to less than 2.4 g/day.

O The saturated fat intake would be the same as that recommended for the general population.
x) © Protein intake should not exceed 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day.

O Potassium intake would only be restricted based on serum potassium level.

So close!

CKD is staged by disease severity, and treatment should be based on the level of progression. In a patient with
stage 5 CKD, sodium should be restricted to <2.4 g/day to control interdialytic fluid gain. In stage 5 CKD, the
patient receiving RRT would reduce and substitute saturated fat with healthier fat sources. When a patient is

weight per day. Potassium intake would only be restricted based on serum potassium laboratory test values in
patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD who are not receiving RRT.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly, because there usually is no

Question 62

The patient with chronic kidney disease has a glomerular filtration rate of 27 mL/min/1.73
m “and a body weight of 180 Ib. The patient is not receiving dialysis. How much protein

should the patient consume daily?
O 16 to 22 g

8 ® 49 to 66 g

O 82 to 106 g
© 108 to 144g

That's right!

Rationale

Protein is generally limited to 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg daily for individuals who are not receiving dialysis and have a
glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. To find protein intake requirements, the nurse
converts the patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms (180/2.2 = 82) and multiplies by the protein cofactors (82
x 0.6 = 49 and 82 x 0.8 = 66). The patient should consume 49 to 66 g of protein daily. Daily protein intake of
16 to 22 g would not be enough for this patient to maintain tissue integrity, while daily protein intakes of 82
to 106 g or 108 to 144 g would be excessive for this patient.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices

p. 400
Question 63

Which condition would the nurse suspect if a patient reports bloody urine and a urinalysis
shows protein in the urine?
©) Diabetes

O Hypertension
O Prostatic hypertrophy

rv) © Acute glomerulonephritis

That's right!

Rationale

Acute glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome are inflammatory diseases that affect the glomeruli, which
are small blood vessels in the cupped membrane at the head of the nephron. Classic symptoms include
hematuria, or blood in the urine, and proteinuria. Edema and hypertension may also be present. Diabetes is
not associated with hematuria. Hypertension may be a present in acute glomerulonephritis but these
symptoms are not indicative of hypertension. Prostatic hypertrophy is an overgrowth of the prostate tissue

and may present as excessive urination at night, frequent urination, or dribbling after urination.

p. 396
Question 64

What is the general recommended daily intake of phosphorus per kilogram of body weight
in the patient with acute kidney injury?

6 ® 3 to 7 mg
i @) 8 to 15 mg

O 0.8 to 1.0 mg

O 1.0 to 1.4 mg

So close!

Rationale

Phosphorus restriction to 8-15 mg per kilogram of body weight daily may be required in the patient with
acute kidney injury. Requirements may increase with daily dialysis, return of kidney function, and anabolism.
The general recommendation is more than 3 to 7 mg, 0.8 to 1.0 mg, and 1.0 to 1.4 mg per kilogram of body
weight.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary
circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 398
Question 65

Under which circumstance should potassium intake be restricted in the patient with chronic
kidney disease?

O For stage 4 chronic kidney disease only
O When fluid intake is restricted
O When sodium intake is restricted

rv) © When serum potassium is elevated

That's right!

Rationale

Potassium intake is usually unrestricted unless the patient’s serum potassium level is high. Potassium intake
restriction is not indicated for patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, when fluid intake is restricted, or
when sodium intake is restricted.

p. 400
Question 66

How many nonprotein calories should be provided for weight maintenance and to meet the
demands of the stress of acute kidney injury?
O 15 to 25 kcal/kg per day

rv) © 25 to 35 kcal/kg per day
O 35 to 45 kcal/kg per day
O 45 to 55 kcal/kg per day

That's right!

Rationale

Nonprotein calories must be provided in sufficient amounts for weight maintenance and to meet the
demands of the stress of acute kidney injury; this is usually 25 to 35 kcal/kg per day. Amounts of 15 to 25
kcal/kg per day would be insufficient, whereas 35 to 45 kcal/kg and 45 to 55 kcal/kg per day would be

excessive.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no

pattern to the answers.

p. 398
Question 67

What is the general recommended daily potassium intake for a patient with acute kidney
injury?

O Less than 1 g

O lto2g
rv) © 2to3¢g

O 3to4¢g

That's right!

Rationale

Potassium requirements depend on laboratory test values and the degree of hyperkalemia. In general, 2 to 3 g
per day is suggested, though requirements may increase with dialysis, restoration of kidney function, and
anabolism. The general recommended daily potassium intake is greater than 1 g, greater than 1 to 2 g, and
less than 3 to 4 g/day.

p. 398
Question 68

What is the general recommended daily sodium intake for patients with acute kidney
injury?
O Less than 1 g

6 ® lto2g

So close!

Rationale

Sodium needs may increase to restore losses from diuresis, but the general recommendation is 2 to 3 g/day.
The general recommended daily sodium intake is greater than 1 g, greater than 1 to 2 g, and less than 3 to 4

g-
p. 398
Question 69

Which factor may contribute to insensible fluid loss in the patient with acute kidney injury?

Cy) © Fever

O Urination
© Diaphoresis
O Sodium intake

That's right!

Rationale

Insensible fluid loss may increase as a result of fever. Urination and diaphoresis are routes of sensible water

loss. Sodium intake does not contribute to fluid loss.

p. 398
Question 70

Which condition marked by an alteration in bone morphology is found in patients with

chronic kidney disease?

O Osteopenia
O Osteoporosis

O Osteomyelitis

rv) © Osteodystrophy

That's right!

Rationale

Osteodystrophy is an alteration of bone morphology found in patients with chronic kidney disease.
Osteopenia occurs when the body makes new bone at a slower rate than it reabsorbs old bone. Osteoporosis
is a condition of weak and brittle bones. Osteomyelitis is inflammation of bone caused by infection.

p. 399
Question 71

Which statement regarding nutrition for patients with chronic kidney disease is incorrect?

©) Dietary guidelines should be adapted as needed for individual patient requirements.
© Fluid intake does not typically require restriction if balanced with output.
@ © A protein-restricted diet can still provide the full daily requirement of all essential nutrients.

© Most animal sources of protein have a higher biological value and are preferred over most plant-
based sources for patients.

That's right!

Rationale

The statement requiring correction is "A protein-restricted diet can still provide the full daily requirement of
all essential nutrients." A protein-restricted diet does not contribute the full daily requirement of all essential
nutrients and usually requires supplementation. It is true that dietary guidelines should be adapted as needed
for individual patient requirements, fluid intake does not typically require restriction if balanced with output,
and most animal sources of protein have a higher biological value and are preferred over most plant-based

sources.

p. 400
Question 72

Which cause of acute kidney injury is due decreased blood supply?

O Uremia

O Nephrosclerosis
© Glomerulonephritis

Cy) © Renal occlusion

That's right!

Rationale

A common cause of acute kidney injury is renal occlusion, which results in decreased blood supply and
subsequent reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Uremia is a symptom of kidney disease marked by
excessive amounts of urea and other nitrogenous waste products in the blood. Nephrosclerosis is necrosis of
the renal arterioles from hypertension, which is a cause of chronic kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is acute

inflammation of the kidneys, often caused by an immune response.

Question 1

Which recommendation would be given when a patient who recently had a
hemorrhoidectomy calls the health care provider reporting pain with defecation?
rv) © "You need to limit your intake of fiber."

O "You should not be taking nonresidual formulas."
O "You should be seen immediately in the emergency department."

O "Pain is not normal with defecation following a hemorrhoidectomy."

That's right!

Rationale

After hemorrhoidectomy, clear fluid diets and fiber-restricted diets will help reduce painful elimination and
allow for healing. Nonresidual commercial elemental formulas would help delay bowel movements until the
surgical area is healed. It would not be appropriate to recommend immediate medical help. Pain at the

surgical site would be normal and an expected finding and should improve as the surgical site heals.

p. 430
Question 2

Which instructions would the nurse provide to a patient about expectations after bariatric

surgery?

O "You will not have any restrictions following surgery.”
O "You will be able to transition to a regular diet within 1 week of surgery."
rv) O "You will need to take supplements that contain iron, calcium, and vitamin D."

x) © "You will need to maintain a clear liquid diet for the first 2 months after surgery."

So close!

Rationale

Micronutrient deficiencies from limited intake and malabsorption warrant multivitamin and mineral
supplementation postoperatively for life. Registered dietitians recommend taking the following supplements
daily after surgery: two multivitamin/mineral supplements with iron, calcium citrate, and vitamin D. The
patient will have some restrictions after surgery, and these should be discussed in detail. Patients usually
progress very slowly from a clear liquid diet to a regular diet (within 2 months) and would not be able to

quickly transition to a regular diet within the first postoperative week.

pp. 427, 429
Question 3

Which action would the nurse take for a patient receiving enteral feedings who is having

diarrhea? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Administer probiotics.

Administer hypertonic solutions.

Give continuous enteral feedings.

M| Administer antidiarrheal medications.

| Discuss with the dietitian about administering feedings that are low in fat.

So close!

Rationale

Patients may develop diarrhea when having enteral feedings. Interventions for patients who are receiving
enteral feedings experiencing diarrhea include administering probiotics, using continuous feedings instead of
bolus feedings, giving antidiarrheal medications if there is no bacterial infection, and considering the use of
formula that is low in fat. Because hypertonic solutions pull water in to the intestines, these solutions should
be avoided in patients experiencing diarrhea on enteral feedings because they would exacerbate the problem.

p.424
Question 4

Which action would the nurse take to help alleviate thirst for a patient receiving enteral

nutrition via a newly placed gastrostomy tube?
rv) O Assist the patient with brushing their teeth.

O Provide a glass of water for the patient to drink.
x) © Administer extra fluid via the gastrostomy tube.

O Recommend that the health care provider order intravenous (IV) fluids.

So close!

Rationale

With a new placement of a gastrostomy tube, the patient should not take anything orally, including fluid. An
appropriate intervention to provide a patient who reports thirst is to assist the patient with brushing their
teeth. It would be inappropriate and possibly dangerous to allow the patient to drink fluids by mouth. The
nurse would need to obtain an order from the health care provider to administer extra fluid via the

gastrostomy tube. Recommending IV fluids may be appropriate for patients not receiving enteral nutrition.

pp. 418-419, 424
Question 5

A postoperative patient is diagnosed with malnutrition. Which characteristic would lead to a
diagnosis of malnutrition? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Weight loss

| Loss of muscle mass

Insufficient energy intake

Decrease in handgrip strength

| Deficiency of vitamins and minerals

So close!

Rationale

Malnutrition poses a significant risk for patients because it contributes to mortality and morbidity, extended
stays in the hospital, and significant additional treatment costs. The diagnosis of malnutrition requires at least
two of the following criteria: weight loss, loss of muscle mass, insufficient energy intake, a diminished
functional status as measured by handgrip strength, loss of subcutaneous fat, and localized or generalized

fluid accumulation. The diagnosis of malnutrition does not require a deficiency in vitamins and minerals.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked

Question 6

Calculate how many milliliters of formula a 60-year old patient with an injury factor of 1.5
would receive at each feeding if they were scheduled for 5 feedings per day with a formula

that has an energy factor of 1.5. The patient is 215 pounds and 6 feet tall.

@ 300 @) 365 mL per feeding

So close!

Rationale

The patient would receive 365 mL per feeding. The formula to calculate the calorie needs uses kilograms for
weight and centimeters for height:

[(10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in centimeters) - (5 x age) +5] x injury factor

First, convert the patient's weight to kilograms: 215 lb + 2.2 kg/Ib = 97.7 kg

And height ft to inches then centimeters: 6 ft x 12 in/ft = 72 in; 72 in x 2.54 cm/in = 182.9 cm.

Now, calculate the patient's basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the first part of the formula above:

[(10 x 97.7 kg) + (6.25 x 182.9 cm) - (5 x 60 years) + 5] = [977 + 1143 - 300 + 5] = 1825 kcal/day

Then, multiple the BMR by the injury factor to calculate the total energy need:

1825 kcal/day x 1.5 = 2737 kcal/day

Each nutrition formula has an energy factor. To calculate how much formula is needed for the day, divide the
total energy need by the formula's energy factor: 2737 + 1.5 = 1825 mL/day
Finally, divide total amount of formula for the day by the number of feedings scheduled: 1825 + 5 = 365

Question 7

When a patient is preparing for elective surgery, which nutritional need should be the

focus? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Restricted fluids

rv) | Increased protein

rv) m| Adequate vitamins

Decreased calcium

rv) mw) Sufficient kilocalories

That's right!

Rationale

When a patient has elective surgery, nutrient stores should be built up to prepare for surgery and promote
recovery. Nutrient stores to build up include protein, vitamins, and kilocalories. Dehydration may occur if
fluids are restricted. Calcium is essential for mineral bone density and should not be decreased.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 412
Question &

Which clinical situation is an indication for parenteral nutrition? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Inflammatory bowel disease

mm) Severe ileus

Nausea and vomiting

wm Severe liver failure

iv)
rv) | Bowel obstruction
iv)

That's right!

Rationale

Severe inflammatory bowel disease, severe ileus, bowel obstruction, and severe liver failure are indications for
parenteral nutrition, which is administered intravenously. Nausea and vomiting, on their own, do not indicate
parenteral nutrition.

p.417
Question 9

A patient receiving enteral nutrition is experiencing diarrhea. Which priority course of

action does the nurse expect the health care provider to take?

rv) O Rule out infection.

O Stop the enteral feeding.
x) © Decrease the rate of feeding.

O Change the enteral formula.

So close!

Rationale
The priority course of action for a patient receiving enteral nutrition and experiencing diarrhea is to rule out

infection. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a common cause of infection and should be ruled out before
stopping enteral feeding, decreasing the rate of feeding, or changing the enteral formula.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

pp. 422-423
Question 10

Which variable is required to calculate the rate and feeding schedule of a patient receiving

enteral nutrition? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

m| Weight

Height

Injury factor

Prealbumin level

Metabolic needs

So close!

Rationale

The patient’s weight, height, injury factor, and metabolic needs are necessary to calculate the appropriate rate
and feeding schedule for enteral nutrition. The prealbumin level is not required for the calculation of the rate
and feeding schedule, but it is a biochemical measure for monitoring the patient once he or she is receiving
enteral nutrition.

p. 422
Question 11

Which intervention can be implemented for the patient receiving enteral nutrition who
experiences tension and fullness?

O Chewing sugarless gum
O Lifting the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees
rv) © Relaxing and breathing deeply after each feeding

O Using continuous feedings instead of bolus feedings

That's right!

Rationale

Having the patient relax and breathe deeply after each feeding should be implemented for the patient
receiving enteral nutrition and experiencing tension and fullness. Chewing sugarless gum will help with thirst
and oral dryness. Lifting the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees helps prevent reflux or aspiration. Using
continuous feedings instead of bolus feedings is an intervention for a patient with diarrhea.

p.424
Question 12

A patient was instructed to maintain a full liquid diet following colostomy bag placement.
Which response would the nurse provide when the patient calls the health care provider

asking for advice regarding foods that can be eaten?

© ©@ "You can have clear broths, strained fruit juices, and popsicles."
O "You can have mashed potatoes, fish, veal, and crackers."
@ © "You can have ice cream, pudding, and pureed vegetables."

© "You can have coffee with cream, frozen yogurt, and cooked cereal."

So close!

Rationale

Full liquid diets contain anything that would melt at room temperature. Foods to suggest to this patient
would include ice cream, pudding, and pureed vegetables. Clear broths, strained fruit juices, and popsicles
would be recommended for a clear liquid diet. Mashed potatoes, fish, veal, and crackers would be suggested
for a patient on a mechanical soft diet. Coffee with cream, frozen yogurt, and cooked cereal would also be

recommended for someone on a mechanical soft diet.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for grammatical inconsistencies. If the response is intended to complete the stem (an
incomplete sentence) but makes no grammatical sense to you, it might be a distractor rather than the correct
response. Question writers typically try to eliminate these inconsistencies.

p. 420
Question 13

The nurse is reviewing the safe ways to assist a patient with meals before delegating the
task to a nursing assistant. Which action is appropriate to review with the nursing assistant?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B] Observe the patient’s appetite.

Offer liquids while the patient is chewing.

| Allow ample time for the patient to chew.

Have simple conversations with the patient.

| Stop assisting the patient when they communicate they have had enough.

That's right!

Rationale

Observing the patient’s appetite will help the nurse and dietitian adapt the patient’s diet to meet individual
needs. Allowing ample time for the patient to chew and between mouthfuls is an important intervention.
Depending on the patient’s conditions, having simple conversations with the patient demonstrates interest in
the patient and would be beneficial. Lastly, when a patient indicates that they are finished, the assistance
should end. The patient should not be forced to eat more. Liquids should be offered between bites of solid

food, not while the patient is chewing.

p. 418
Question 14

Which patient would require parenteral nutrition?

© A patient who has cystic fibrosis and a body mass index in the 10th percentile
© ©@ A patient who had a traumatic brain injury who is unable to swallow
© A patient with short gut syndrome who has had minimal resection of the bowel

@ © A patient who recently suffered severe burns and reports nausea and vomiting

So close!

Rationale

Parenteral nutrition is recommended for individuals without a functioning lower gastrointestinal system and
those with major trauma and burns, intestinal atresia, or severe pancreatitis. A patient with cystic fibrosis,
traumatic brain injury, and short gut syndrome with minimal bowel resection would be better candidates for
enteral nutrition.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five

consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p. 416
Question 15

A patient recently started receiving enteral nutrition. Which action would the nurse take to

monitor for complications? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.
Cy) | Assess for edema
Cy) | Monitor stool output
Cy) | Check gastric residuals
@ |B] Record intake and output
@ |B) Palpate for abdominal pain
@ |B] Inform the health care provider if diarrhea occurs
I .
That's right!
Rationale

Nurses continuously monitor patients who receive enteral nutrition for appropriate feeding schedules,
tolerance, and potential complications. Nurses assess for signs and symptoms of edema, monitor stool output
and consistency, check gastric residuals, check fluid balance by recording intake and output, assess for
abdominal distention and tenderness, and inform the health care provider if the patient experiences diarrhea.

Before making changes to the enteral feeding protocol because of diarrhea, the health care provider should
rule out the common culprits, such as medications or Clostridium difficile enterocolitis.

pp. 422, 423
Question 16

Which recommendation would the nurse provide before discharging a patient from the

hospital after a gastrectomy? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| "Eat as tolerated."

"Stick to a bland diet."

"Food should be low in bulk."

| “Eat small and frequent meals."

| "Food should be easily digestible."

So close!

Rationale

A gastrectomy is removal of part or all of the stomach. The basic principles of diet therapy for the immediate
postgastrectomy period involve both the size of the meals (which should be small and frequent) and the
nature of the meals (which are generally simple, easily digested, bland, and low in bulk). Patients may have
small frequent meals, as tolerated.

p. 427
Question 17

Which response would the nurse provide regarding a nutrition plan to a patient with burns
that cover 15% of the total body surface area on the lower extremities and torso and is

currently in the flow phase?
@ © “You will be able to eat by mouth."

© ©@ “You will need to receive nutrition through an IV."
© "Right now, our main concern is fluid resuscitation."

© "We need to let your bowels rest, so you are not able to eat or drink anything."

So close!

Rationale

Most patients with burns that cover less than 20% of the total body surface area can consume an oral meal
plan that is adequate in nutrient needs. Receiving nutrition through an IV would only be necessary if the
patient is unable to consume an adequate amount of nutrients by mouth or if gastrointestinal feedings are
not possible. Health care providers resuscitate patients with large amounts of IV fluids and electrolyte therapy
during the ebb phase, not the flow phase, to prevent shock. Typically, nutrition therapy begins within 24 to 48
hours after the injury.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five
consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p. 431
Question 18

Which action would the nurse take as a priority for a patient admitted for extreme burns
who is in ebb phase?

O Administer vitamin C supplement
O Administer vitamin A supplement

rv) © Administer large amounts of intravenous (IV) fluid

O Encourage a large carbohydrate intake

That's right!

Rationale

The ebb phase is the period immediately after a trauma, such as a burn. Burn shock is a condition resulting
from the loss of large amounts of fluid that occurs during the first hours until approximately the second day
after a burn. To prevent shock, patients should be resuscitated with large amounts of IV fluids and electrolyte
therapy. Vitamin C and vitamin A supplements are recommended for patients with burns but would not be the
priority during the ebb phase. Adequate energy intake from carbohydrates is important in the recovery of burn
patients but is not the top priority during the ebb phase.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

pp. 430-431
Question 19

Which instructions would the nurse provide to a patient about expectations after bariatric

surgery?

O "You will not have any restrictions following surgery.”
O "You will be able to transition to a regular diet within 1 week of surgery."
rv) © "You will need to take supplements that contain iron, calcium, and vitamin D."

O "You will need to maintain a clear liquid diet for the first 2 months after surgery."

That's right!

Rationale

Micronutrient deficiencies from limited intake and malabsorption warrant multivitamin and mineral
supplementation postoperatively for life. Registered dietitians recommend taking the following supplements
daily after surgery: two multivitamin/mineral supplements with iron, calcium citrate, and vitamin D. The
patient will have some restrictions after surgery, and these should be discussed in detail. Patients usually
progress very slowly from a clear liquid diet to a regular diet (within 2 months) and would not be able to

quickly transition to a regular diet within the first postoperative week.

pp. 427, 429
Question 20

Which action would the nurse take for a patient receiving enteral feedings who is having

diarrhea? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Administer probiotics.

Administer hypertonic solutions.

Give continuous enteral feedings.

Administer antidiarrheal medications.

| Discuss with the dietitian about administering feedings that are low in fat.

So close!

Rationale

Patients may develop diarrhea when having enteral feedings. Interventions for patients who are receiving
enteral feedings experiencing diarrhea include administering probiotics, using continuous feedings instead of
bolus feedings, giving antidiarrheal medications if there is no bacterial infection, and considering the use of
formula that is low in fat. Because hypertonic solutions pull water in to the intestines, these solutions should
be avoided in patients experiencing diarrhea on enteral feedings because they would exacerbate the problem.

p.424
Question 21

Which action would the nurse take to help alleviate thirst for a patient receiving enteral

nutrition via a newly placed gastrostomy tube?
rv) © Assist the patient with brushing their teeth.

O Provide a glass of water for the patient to drink.
O Administer extra fluid via the gastrostomy tube.

O Recommend that the health care provider order intravenous (IV) fluids.

That's right!

Rationale

With a new placement of a gastrostomy tube, the patient should not take anything orally, including fluid. An
appropriate intervention to provide a patient who reports thirst is to assist the patient with brushing their
teeth. It would be inappropriate and possibly dangerous to allow the patient to drink fluids by mouth. The
nurse would need to obtain an order from the health care provider to administer extra fluid via the
gastrostomy tube. Recommending IV fluids may be appropriate for patients not receiving enteral nutrition.

pp. 418-419, 424
Question 22

An older patient in a long-term care facility recently had back surgery and requires

assistance with eating. Which guideline would support patient independence?

O Require that the patient obtain their own tray.

O Provide standard utensils for the patient to use.

O Avoid asking the patient if they require assistance.
rv) © Cut the food before bringing the meal to the patient.

That's right!

Rationale

Cutting food before bringing food into the patient’s room will help promote a feeling of independence.
Requiring that patients obtain their own tray may not be feasible. Providing special utensils that help the
patient eat their meal independently and more easily will help promote a feeling of independence; standard
utensils may lead to frustration and a feeling of dependence. Patients should be asked if they need any
assistance. The health care provider can assist a patient while still allowing for patient independence.

p. 418
Question 23

A postoperative patient is diagnosed with malnutrition. Which characteristic would lead to a
diagnosis of malnutrition? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

| Weight loss

Loss of muscle mass

|
| Insufficient energy intake
|

Decrease in handgrip strength

Deficiency of vitamins and minerals

That's right!

Rationale

Malnutrition poses a significant risk for patients because it contributes to mortality and morbidity, extended
stays in the hospital, and significant additional treatment costs. The diagnosis of malnutrition requires at least
two of the following criteria: weight loss, loss of muscle mass, insufficient energy intake, a diminished
functional status as measured by handgrip strength, loss of subcutaneous fat, and localized or generalized

fluid accumulation. The diagnosis of malnutrition does not require a deficiency in vitamins and minerals.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 412
Question 24

Which test is a biochemical measure used to monitor patients receiving enteral nutrition?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

C-reactive protein (CRP)

Cy) | Glucose

D-dimer test

@ |B] Serum electrolytes

Cy) Blood urea nitrogen

International normalized ratio (INR)

So close!

Rationale

Some of the biochemical measures used to monitor patients receiving enteral nutrition are glucose, serum
electrolytes, and blood urea nitrogen. C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer test, and INR are not monitored in
patients receiving enteral nutrition. CRP is used to check for infection or inflammation in the body. D-dimer
test is used to monitor blood-clotting issues. INR measures the time for the blood to clot.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very
cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and in an area as complex
as nursing, an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a
guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number

of choices.

p. 423
Question 25

Which hospital diet contains foods that are liquid and melt at room temperature?
P g P
© Clear liquid diet

@ ©@ Full liquid diet

© Mechanically altered diet
© Regular house diet

That's right!

Rationale

A full-liquid diet contains anything that would melt at room temperature and is used only temporarily during
recovery. Clear liquids consist of foods that are transparent liquid at body temperature and require minimal
digestion. A mechanically altered diet consists of foods that are easy to swallow (i.e., they are blended,
chopped, ground, or mashed). A regular house diet consists of foods of all textures, taken when the patient

has no difficulty chewing or swallowing.

p. 420
Question 26

Calculate how many milliliters of formula a 60-year old patient with an injury factor of 1.5

would receive at each feeding if they were scheduled for 5 feedings per day with a formula

that has an energy factor of 1.5. The patient is 215 pounds and 6 feet tall. @} 365 mL

per feeding

That's right!

Rationale

The patient would receive 365 mL per feeding. The formula to calculate the calorie needs uses kilograms for
weight and centimeters for height:

[(10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in centimeters) - (5 x age) +5] x injury factor

First, convert the patient's weight to kilograms: 215 lb + 2.2 kg/Ib = 97.7 kg

And height ft to inches then centimeters: 6 ft x 12 in/ft = 72 in; 72 in x 2.54 cm/in = 182.9 cm.

Now, calculate the patient's basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the first part of the formula above:

[(10 x 97.7 kg) + (6.25 x 182.9 cm) - (5 x 60 years) + 5] = [977 + 1143 - 300 + 5] = 1825 kcal/day

Then, multiple the BMR by the injury factor to calculate the total energy need:

1825 kcal/day x 1.5 = 2737 kcal/day

Each nutrition formula has an energy factor. To calculate how much formula is needed for the day, divide the
total energy need by the formula's energy factor: 2737 + 1.5 = 1825 mL/day
Finally, divide total amount of formula for the day by the number of feedings scheduled: 1825 + 5 = 365

Question 27

A patient receiving enteral nutrition is experiencing diarrhea. Which priority course of

action does the nurse expect the health care provider to take?

rv) © Rule out infection.

O Stop the enteral feeding.
O Decrease the rate of feeding.

O Change the enteral formula.

That's right!

Rationale
The priority course of action for a patient receiving enteral nutrition and experiencing diarrhea is to rule out
infection. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a common cause of infection and should be ruled out before

stopping enteral feeding, decreasing the rate of feeding, or changing the enteral formula.

That's right!

Rationale

The patient’s weight, height, injury factor, and metabolic needs are necessary to calculate the appropriate rate
and feeding schedule for enteral nutrition. The prealbumin level is not required for the calculation of the rate
and feeding schedule, but it is a biochemical measure for monitoring the patient once he or she is receiving

Question 36

Which teaching would the nurse provide regarding protein intake to a patient recovering

from a burn?
rv) © "Protein intake should be 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day."

O "We want you to consume as much protein as possible to help with healing."
O "Protein intake should be approximately 60% of your total calorie intake."

O "We will calculate how much protein you need and that will remain constant throughout your
recovery.”

That's right!

Rationale

High-quality protein intake is crucial to promote early wound healing and support immune function.
Individual protein needs vary from 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day to equal 20% to 25% of the total energy intake.
Overfeeding the patient is harmful and increases metabolic stress. Approximately 55% to 60% of total
kilocalories would come from carbohydrates, not protein. The dietitian will calculate energy needs, which must

be reassessed frequently to meet the patient’s changing requirements.

Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all
options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely. Example: [fthe answer you are seeking is directed to a
specific treatment and all but one option deal with signs and symptoms, you would be correct in choosing the

treatment-specific option.

Question 37

A patient had a gastric resection 1 week ago. Twenty minutes after eating, the patient starts
to experience cramping, pain, dizziness, and diarrhea. Which condition is the patient
experiencing?

© Food allergy
@ @ Dumping syndrome

© Gastrointestinal illness

© Infection at the surgical site

That's right!

Rationale

Dumping syndrome is the most frequently encountered complication after extensive gastric resection. After
the initial recovery from surgery, when a person begins to feel better and starts to eat a regular diet, the
patient may experience discomfort 10 to 20 minutes after meals. Dumping syndrome causes cramping, a full
feeling and increased heart rate, and a wave of weakness, cold sweating, and dizziness may occur. Abdominal
pain and diarrhea terminate the event. Food allergies and gastrointestinal illness can cause abdominal pain
and diarrhea but are not the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms. Infection at the surgical site may

present as continual pain and fever.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

Question 38

Which cue is a clinical indication for enteral nutrition support?

© The patient’s bowels need to rest.
© There is no access to a feeding tube.
© ©@ The patient does not have sufficient gastrointestinal tract functioning.

@ © The patient cannot eat enough to meet their nutrition needs orally.

So close!

Rationale

The registered dietitian and health care provider will decide the most appropriate method of medical nutrition
therapy. Enteral nutrition is nutrition delivered to the gastrointestinal tract via a tube. If a patient is unable to
eat enough to meet their nutrient needs orally, enteral nutrition would be indicated. If bowel rest is indicated,
if there is no access to a feeding tube, or if the patient does not have sufficient gastrointestinal tract function,

parenteral nutrition support would be indicated.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 418
Question 39

Which function does protein perform that is essential during the postoperative period?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| Wound healing
rv] m| Proper bone formation
rv] | Infection prevention
rv] mw] Blood volume maintenance
rv] | Transportation of fat through circulation
I °
That's right!
Rationale

It is important for patients to consume optimal amounts of protein during the postoperative period.
Immediately following major surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass graft, the body tissues undergo
considerable catabolism. In addition to protein lost from the breakdown of tissue, other losses of protein may
occur. During wound healing, a patient’s dietary protein needs increase to restore lost protein and to build
new tissues at the wound site. Protein and minerals are essential to the foundation of bone formation. Protein
is a major component of the body’s immune system. An adequate supply of the plasma protein albumin is
necessary to maintain blood volume. Protein is necessary to transport fat through circulation to all tissues and
to the liver for metabolism.

pp. 414-415
Question 40

A patient is scheduled to have bariatric surgery. Which dietary restriction would the nurse

communicate to the patient before the surgery?
@ @ Fiber-restricted diet

O Protein-restricted diet
O Saturated fat-restricted diet

O Carbohydrate-restricted diet

That's right!

Rationale

The health care team often recommends a fiber-restricted diet several days before gastrointestinal surgery to
clear the surgical site of food residue. Every surgical patient should be equipped with adequate body protein
to counteract blood loss during surgery and prevent tissue catabolism. Carbohydrates and fats are necessary

before surgery when patients need protein to build and repair tissue.

pp. 412-414
Question 41

A patient is scheduled for abdominal surgery in the morning and is informed that eating
and drinking before surgery is prohibited. Which amount of time is required to remain

without food or drink before surgery?

@ © Bhours
O 4hours
O 2Zhours
O 6 hours

That's right!

Rationale

Nothing should be taken orally for at least 8 hours before a surgical procedure. Abstaining from food and
drink 2, 4, or 6 hours before surgery would not be adequate to ensure that food is not retained in the
stomach. The presence of food in the stomach during surgery may cause complications, such as aspiration

during anesthesia or vomiting after the procedure.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices

will seem like the correct response.

pp. 413-414
Question 42

Which type of nutritional therapy is recommended for patients after a hemorrhoidectomy
to reduce painful elimination and allow healing?

rv) © Nonresidue commercial elemental formulas

O Regular diet
O High-fiber diet

O Parenteral nutrition feedings

That's right!

Rationale

For a brief period after rectal surgery or hemorrhoidectomy, clear fluid or fiber-restricted diets help to reduce
painful elimination and allow for healing. Nonresidue commercial elemental formulas help delay bowel
movements until the surgical area has healed. Regular or high-fiber diets are not recommended for patients
following a hemorrhoidectomy. Parenteral nutrition specifically refers to the feeding of nutrients directly into

the blood circulation through certain veins (e.g., a peripheral vein in the arm or the subclavian vein).

p. 430
Question 43

Intake of which nutrient needs to be reduced to facilitate patient recovery after gallbladder

surgery?
O Carbohydrates

O Calcium

O Vitamin C

rv) © Fats

That's right!

Rationale

After surgery, reducing fat in the diet (e.g., less than 30% of total energy intake as fat) facilitates wound
healing and comfort. The hormonal stimulus for bile continues to function, thus causing pain with the high
intake of fatty foods. Carbohydrates, calcium, and vitamin C are not metabolized by the action of bile.

p. 427
Question 44

Which type of nutrition therapy is ideal for severely debilitated patients who have had
radical neck or facial surgery?
O Oral liquid feeding

O Mechanical soft diet

rv) © Enteral tube feeding
O Regular diet

That's right!

Rationale

Severely debilitated patients who have had radical neck or facial surgery may benefit from tube feedings. For
long-term needs, enteral feeding equipment and standardized commercial formulas have made it possible to
continue enteral nutrition at home. Oral liquid feeding, mechanical soft diets, and regular diets are not ideal

for severely debilitated patients who have had radical neck or facial surgery.

p. 426
Question 45

Which equipment is used in continuous feedings?

O Intravenous catheter
O Syringe pumps

@ ©@ Feeding pump
© Gravity drip

That's right!

Rationale

Continuous feeding is an enteral feeding schedule whereby formula is infused via a feeding pump over a 24-
hour period. An intravenous catheter is used for parenteral nutrition when the patient needs full nutrition
support for longer periods. The surgeon will place the catheter into a large central vein (usually the subclavian
vein). A syringe or gravity drip is used for bolus feedings, which involve the administration of enteral nutrition

over a few minutes, given in several feedings per day.

p. 422
Question 46

Which type of food is included in a clear liquid hospital diet?
@ ©@ Foods that are transparent liquid at body temperature and require minimal digestion

©) Foods that would melt at room temperature
©) Foods that are blended

O Foods of all textures

That's right!

Rationale

A clear liquid diet consists of foods that are transparent liquid at body temperature and require minimal
digestion. A full-liquid diet contains anything that would melt at room temperature and is used only
temporarily during recovery. A mechanically altered diet consists of foods that are easy to swallow (i.e., they
are blended, chopped, ground, or mashed). A regular house diet consists of foods of all textures, taken when

the patient has no difficulty chewing or swallowing.

p. 420
Question 47

Which criterion is considered for selecting central parenteral nutrition support therapy?

© Functional gastrointestinal tract

@ ©@ Long-term therapy needed
© Need for bowel rest

© Length of therapy of up to 14 days

That's right!

Rationale

Central parenteral nutrition support is considered when long-term therapy is needed. Enteral nutrition
support Is indicated for patients with enough functional gastrointestinal tract to allow adequate digestion and
absorption. Parenteral nutrition support is considered when there is a need for bowel rest (e.g., enteral
fistulas, acute inflammatory bowel disease). Peripheral parenteral nutrition is indicated when the length of

therapy is short, usually up to 14 days.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

p. 418
Question 48

A health care provider is determining the most appropriate form of nutrition for a patient
after bone marrow transplantation. Which cue indicates that it would be appropriate for a

patient to receive central parenteral nutrition?

© @ The patient is not hypermetabolic.
@ © The patient has poor peripheral access.
© The patient has a fluid restriction.

© The length of therapy is expected to be less than 10 days.

So close!

Rationale

The term parenteral nutrition refers to any feeding method not involving the gastrointestinal tract. Central
parenteral nutrition is appropriate when the energy and nutrient requirement is large or when the patient
needs full nutrition support for longer periods. If a patient has poor peripheral access, central parenteral
nutrition would be recommended. For central parenteral nutrition to be appropriate, the patient would be
hypermetabolic, the patient would not have a fluid restriction, and the expected course of therapy would
exceed 14 days.

pp. 418, 424
Question 49

The nurse is caring for a patient recovering from an extensive surgery. Which oral clinical
diet would be ordered for this patient?

O High-fat, high-kilocalorie

O Low-protein, decreased-kilocalorie
rv) © High-protein, increased-kilocalorie

O Fluid restriction, increased-potassium

That's right!

Rationale

If a patient has had extensive surgery, a high-protein, increased-kilocalorie diet is needed to meet the
increased demands of healing. A high-fat, high-kilocalorie diet would be ordered for a patient who needs to
gain weight. Protein should not be low because this can hinder wound healing. Fluids should be increased in

a patient recovering from extensive surgery.

p.415
Question 50

Which enteral feeding route poses the highest risk for aspiration?

Cy) © Nasogastric
O Jejunostomy
©) Nasoducdenal

O Gastrostomy

That's right!

Rationale
The nasogastric route poses the greatest risk for aspiration. Jejunostomy poses no risk for aspiration. The

nasoduodenal route and the gastrostomy tube pose a lower risk for aspiration than the nasogastric route.

p. 418
Question 51

The catheter used for central parenteral nutrition (PN) is placed in which vessel?

© Cephalic artery

© Basilic artery
© Metacarpal vein

Cy) © Subclavian vein

That's right!

Rationale
For central PN, the catheter is placed in a large-diameter vein such as the subclavian vein. Central PN

catheters are not placed in arteries, and the metacarpal vein is too small for a central PN catheter.

p.424
Question 52

Which factor is the primary consideration when selecting the peripheral route for parenteral
nutrition?

O Patient’s disease state
rv) © Osmolality of the solution
O Duration of infusion administration

O Frequency of nutrition administration

That's right!

Rationale

The osmolality of the solution is the primary consideration when choosing the peripheral access route for
administration of parenteral nutrition. A higher osmolality solution is a reflection of the concentration of its
total particles. Small peripheral veins, usually in the arm, are used to deliver less concentrated solutions (900
mOsm/L or less). The patient’s disease state, duration of nutrition infusion administration, and frequency of
nutritional administration are taken into consideration, but the osmolality of the solution requires specific

access routes making it the primary consideration.

p.424
Question 53

Which dietary change is an example of texture being modified?
@ ©@ Clear liquid to regular

©, Low sodium to regular
© High potassium to low potassium
©, 1500 kcal/day to 2000 kcal/day

That's right!

Rationale
The texture of a diet is changed when going from clear liquids to a regular diet. The texture will not change

with changes in sodium, potassium, or calorie intake.

p. 418
Question 54

Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition for which reason? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Is less invasive

| Is less expensive

Allows the gut to rest

rv) m| Preserves gut function

| Decreases risk factors

That's right!

Rationale

Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it is less invasive, is less expensive, preserves
gut function, and decreases risk factors. Enteral nutrition does not allow the gut to rest; the nutrition is

delivered directly into the gastrointestinal tract.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 418
Question 55

The nurse receives an order to initiate enteral nutrition via a nasogastric (NG) tube for a
patient with a bowel obstruction. Which action should the nurse take?

O Initiate the enteral feeding at a lower rate.
O Initiate the enteral feeding at the ordered rate.
rv) O Discuss the order with the health care provider.
x) © Verify placement of the NG tube before the feeding.

So close!

Rationale

When receiving an order to initiate enteral nutrition via an NG tube for a patient with bowel obstruction, the
nurse should discuss the order with the health care provider because enteral nutrition is contraindicated for a
patient with a bowel obstruction. The nurse does not have the legal right to change an order but does have a
legal obligation to protect the patient from harm. The enteral feeding should not be administered; therefore
initiation at a lower rate or the ordered rate and verification of the NG tube placement before feeding are not

necessary.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 419
Question 56

The nurse is caring for a patient who is not at risk for aspiration and requires long-term
enteral nutritional therapy. Which procedure does the nurse anticipate for accessing a safe

nutritional route?

O Enterostomy

© Esophagostomy

O Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy

Cy) © Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy

That's right!

Rationale

A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy involves placing a tube through the abdominal wall into the stomach
and is utilized for a patient who is not at risk for aspiration. A patient who is at risk for aspiration and requires
enteral nutritional therapy will need a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy. An enterostomy is the surgical
placement of the tube at progressive points along the gastrointestinal tract. An esophagostomy is the creation
of an artificial opening in the esophagus at the level of the cervical spine and is used after head and neck
surgeries or traumatic injury.

p. 419
Question 57

What is the best route for short-term enteral therapy?

Cy) © Nasoenteric

O Enterostomy

O Nasojejunal
O Nasoduodenal

That's right!

Rationale
The most appropriate route for short-term enteral therapy is the nasoenteric route. It is passed through the
nose into the stomach or small intestine and is indicated for short-term therapy of 6 weeks or less in many

clinical situations. An enterostomy is the surgical placement of a tube and is indicated for long-term feedings.
Nasojejunal and nasoduodenal routes are types of nasoenteric feeding routes.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 419
Question 58

Protein is important in the postoperative recovery period for which purpose?

O To facilitate weight loss
© To prevent dehydration

@ ©@ 1o repair tissue breakdown
© To replace electrolytes

That's right!

Rationale
Protein intake in the postoperative period helps repair tissue breakdown from surgery. Protein will help with
muscle-building and weight gain; weight loss is not a desired outcome. Fluids will help prevent dehydration,

and vitamins will provide electrolyte replacement.

p. 412
Question 59

Which perioperative clinical problem is often related to poor nutritional status? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Longer hospital stay

Delayed wound healing

ncreased mortality rate

ncreased risk for infection

Decreased necessity of parenteral nutrition

That's right!

Rationale
Perioperative patients with poor nutritional status are at increased risk for longer hospital stays, delayed
wound healing, and increased risk for mortality and infection. A perioperative patient with poor nutritional

status has an increased necessity for parenteral nutrition.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 412
Question 60

Which type of enteral nutritional formula is designed for a patient with a fully functional

gastrointestinal (Gl) tract?

rv) © Polymeric

O Semi-elemental
O Single-nutrient
O Hydrolyzed elemental

That's right!

Rationale
Polymeric formulas are made from intact nutrients for use with a fully functioning GI tract. Semi-elemental,

single-nutrient, and hydrolyzed elemental formulas are used for patients who do not have fully functioning Gl

tracts because these formulas are readily absorbed with minimal residue.

p. 421
Question 61

At which rate does the nurse expect to initiate the administration of an enteral feeding for a

patient who is critically ill?

rv) O 10 to 40 mL/hr

x) © 60 to 120 mL/hr
O 150 to 520 mL/hr

O 240 to 720 mL/hr

So close!

Rationale

The nurse should expect to initiate the administration of an enteral feeding for a patient who is critically ill at a
rate of 10 to 40 mL/hr. Critically ill patients or those who have not been fed enterally for some time will not be
able to tolerate large feedings at initiation. Adults who are receiving bolus feedings introduced into the
stomach tolerate full-strength formulas initially at a rate of 60 to 120 mL/hr every 8 to 12 hours until the goal
volume for nutrient needs are met. The rate of 150 to 520 mL is not applicable to a specific situation. The rate
of 240 to 720 mL/hr is typical for intermittent feedings infused over a 20- to 60-minute period, four to six
times daily.

p. 422
Question 62

Which biochemical marker is measured weekly after the initiation of enteral nutrition?
© Fluid balance

O Creatinine

Cy) © Prealbumin

© Amylase

That's right!

Rationale

The biochemical marker that is measured after the initiation of enteral nutrition is prealbumin, a marker for
protein malnutrition. Fluid balance is not a biochemical marker; it is part of a physical assessment. Creatinine
and amylase are not biochemical markers that are monitored after the initiation of enteral nutrition.
Creatinine is a reflection of kidney function, and amylase is reflective of pancreatic function.

p. 423
Question 63

Which component of the patient’s diet should be modified for the patient having difficulty
chewing food?

rv) © Texture
O Protein

O Kilocalories
O Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale
The texture of the patient’s food should be changed to soft to accommodate the patient’s difficulty chewing.

Protein, kilocalories, and carbohydrates do not need to be altered.

p. 418
Question 64

Which nutrient is crucial to promote early wound healing in medical nutrition therapy for

burn patients?

rv) © Protein

O Carbohydrate
O Vitamin A

O Zinc

That's right!

Rationale

High-quality protein intake is crucial to promote early wound healing and to support immune function.
Depending on the extent of the burn and the associated catabolic losses, individual protein needs vary from
1.5 to 2 g/kg/day in adults and from 2.5 to 4 g/kg/day in children. Adequate energy intake spares protein for
tissue rebuilding and meets the increased metabolic demands of the whole body. Approximately 55% to 60%
of the total kilocalories should come from carbohydrates, along with a moderate amount of fat (<35% of kcal).
Supplementation with vitamin A (10,000 IU/day) and zinc is important for optimal immune function.
Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be very helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best
choice and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which
one completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,
pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 431
Question 65

Which layer of skin is involved in third-degree burns? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Epidermis
Cy) ™| Dermis

Muscle

Cy) Underlying fat layer

Bone

So close!

Rationale

Third-degree, or full-thickness, burns result in complete skin loss, including the epidermis, dermis, and
underlying fat layer. Superficial (i-e., first-degree) burns involve cell damage only to the epidermis. Second-
degree burns are either superficial partial-thickness burns, which involve cell damage to the dermis, or deep
partial-thickness burns, which involve both the first and second layers of skin. Subdermal (i.e., fourth-degree)
burns leave bone and tendon exposed.

p. 430
Question 66

Which method of feeding provides nourishment by bypassing the gastrointestinal tract?

O Enteral
Cy) © Parenteral

O Nasogastric
© Assisted oral

That's right!

Rationale

Parenteral method of nutrition support is nourishment through the veins (either small peripheral veins or a
large central vein) and bypasses the gastrointestinal tract. In medical nutrition therapy, enteral feedings imply
tube feedings through the regular gastrointestinal route. Oral nourishment through the regular
gastrointestinal route, including nasogastric tube feedings and assisted oral feedings, do not bypass the

gastrointestinal tract.

p.417
Question 67

Which nutrient is lost due to catabolic action of body tissue during the postoperative

recovery period? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Phosphorus

mi lron

Vitamin C

mw! Sodium

rv) | Potassium

So close!

Rationale

Immediately after major surgery, the body tissue may undergo considerable catabolism, which means that the
process of tissue breakdown and loss exceeds the process of tissue buildup (i-e., anabolism), leading to protein
loss. Tissue catabolism also results in the loss of potassium and phosphorus from cells. Nutrients such as

iron, vitamin C, and sodium are not lost due to catabolic action of body tissue during the postoperative
recovery period.

p. 416
Question 68

Which nutrient is essential to counteract blood loss during surgery and prevent tissue

catabolism during the immediate postoperative period?

rv) © Protein
O Fat

O Vitamin C

O Dietary fiber

That's right!

Rationale

Every surgical patient should be equipped with adequate body protein to counteract blood loss during surgery
and prevent tissue catabolism during the immediate postoperative period. Fat, vitamin C, and dietary fiber are
not nutrients essential to counteract blood loss during surgery and prevent tissue catabolism.

p. 412
Question 69

Which characteristic is included in the diagnosis of clinical malnutrition? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Insufficient energy intake

m| Weight loss

ncreased muscle mass

| Fluid depletion

rv) | Decrease in subcutaneous fat

So close!

Rationale

A diagnosis of malnutrition requires that a patient meet two or more of the following criteria: insufficient
energy intake, weight loss, loss of muscle mass, and loss of subcutaneous fat and fluid accumulation.
Increased muscle mass and fluid depletion are not included in the diagnosis of clinical malnutrition.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 412
Question 70

The patient receiving enteral nutrition experiences discomfort at the site of the gastrostomy
tube. Which action would be indicated?

O Reduce the infusion rate of the feeding.
O Use continuous feedings instead of bolus feedings.
O Instruct the patient to breathe after each feeding.

rv) © Recognize that a smaller tube may be indicated, and discuss the plan of care with the health care
provider.

That's right!

Rationale

Tube discomfort is a common problem that patients have with enteral nutrition tubes. Requesting that the
patient have a smaller tube inserted may alleviate the patient’s pain and discomfort. Reducing the infusion
rate may help if the patient is experiencing reflux or aspiration. Using continuous feedings instead of bolus
feedings may help if the patient is experiencing diarrhea. Instructing the patient to relax and breathe deeply
after each feeding may help if the patient is experiencing fullness or tension.

p.424
Question 71

A patient had surgery to remove a portion of the ileum and had an ileostomy bag placed 1
day ago. Which response would the nurse provide if the patient requests to eat?

O "| will order you some foods high in fiber"
rv) O "Your health care provider ordered a clear liquid diet."
O "It's important to start out with a pureed diet."

x) © “Unfortunately, you cannot have anything to eat or drink yet."

So close!

Rationale

Patients with a newly placed ileostomy bag begin with a clear liquid diet during the immediate postoperative
period and progress toward small, frequent feeding meals that are relatively low in dietary fiber. Starting with
solid foods, even pureed foods, is not recommended in the immediate postoperative period. Informing a
patient that they are restricted from food and drink would be incorrect because a clear liquid diet is usually
ordered.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the stem of the question such as first, primary, early, or best are
important. Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a
wrong response. As in life, no real absolutes exist in nursing; however, every rule has its exceptions, so answer
with care.

p. 429
Question 72

Which teaching would the nurse provide regarding protein intake to a patient recovering

from a burn?
rv) © "Protein intake should be 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day."

O "We want you to consume as much protein as possible to help with healing."
O "Protein intake should be approximately 60% of your total calorie intake."

O "We will calculate how much protein you need and that will remain constant throughout your
recovery.”

That's right!

Rationale

High-quality protein intake is crucial to promote early wound healing and support immune function.
Individual protein needs vary from 1.5 to 2 g/kg/day to equal 20% to 25% of the total energy intake.
Overfeeding the patient is harmful and increases metabolic stress. Approximately 55% to 60% of total
kilocalories would come from carbohydrates, not protein. The dietitian will calculate energy needs, which must

be reassessed frequently to meet the patient’s changing requirements.

Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all
options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely. Example: [fthe answer you are seeking is directed to a
specific treatment and all but one option deal with signs and symptoms, you would be correct in choosing the

treatment-specific option.

p. 431
Question 73

Which recommendation would be given when a patient who recently had a
hemorrhoidectomy calls the health care provider reporting pain with defecation?
rv) © "You need to limit your intake of fiber."

O "You should not be taking nonresidual formulas."
O "You should be seen immediately in the emergency department."

O "Pain is not normal with defecation following a hemorrhoidectomy."

That's right!

Rationale

After hemorrhoidectomy, clear fluid diets and fiber-restricted diets will help reduce painful elimination and
allow for healing. Nonresidual commercial elemental formulas would help delay bowel movements until the
surgical area is healed. It would not be appropriate to recommend immediate medical help. Pain at the

surgical site would be normal and an expected finding and should improve as the surgical site heals.

p. 430
Question 74

Which instruction would the nurse provide a patient recovering from a cholecystectomy and

preparing to be discharged home?
rv) © "You will need to limit your fat intake."

O "You will need to limit your sodium intake."
O "You will need to limit your protein intake."

O "You will need to limit your carbohydrate intake."

That's right!

Rationale

A cholecystectomy is the removal of the gallbladder. The hormonal stimulus for bile continues to function,
causing pain with a high intake of fatty foods. Reducing fat intake to less than 30% of the patient’s total
energy intake facilitates health and comfort. Protein helps with wound healing and would not be limited
following a cholecystectomy. Carbohydrates are needed for energy and would not be limited following
removal of the gallbladder. Limiting sodium intake after a cholecystectomy is not a typical recommendation.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,
read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 427
Question 75

A patient had a gastric resection 1 week ago. Twenty minutes after eating, the patient starts
to experience cramping, pain, dizziness, and diarrhea. Which condition is the patient
experiencing?

© Food allergy
@ @ Dumping syndrome

© Gastrointestinal illness

© Infection at the surgical site

That's right!

Rationale

Dumping syndrome is the most frequently encountered complication after extensive gastric resection. After
the initial recovery from surgery, when a person begins to feel better and starts to eat a regular diet, the
patient may experience discomfort 10 to 20 minutes after meals. Dumping syndrome causes cramping, a full
feeling and increased heart rate, and a wave of weakness, cold sweating, and dizziness may occur. Abdominal
pain and diarrhea terminate the event. Food allergies and gastrointestinal illness can cause abdominal pain
and diarrhea but are not the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms. Infection at the surgical site may

present as continual pain and fever.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

p. 427
Question 76

Which cue is a clinical indication for enteral nutrition support?
© ©@ The patient's bowels need to rest.

© There is no access to a feeding tube.
© The patient does not have sufficient gastrointestinal tract functioning.

@ © The patient cannot eat enough to meet their nutrition needs orally.

So close!

Rationale

The registered dietitian and health care provider will decide the most appropriate method of medical nutrition
therapy. Enteral nutrition is nutrition delivered to the gastrointestinal tract via a tube. If a patient is unable to
eat enough to meet their nutrient needs orally, enteral nutrition would be indicated. If bowel rest is indicated,
if there is no access to a feeding tube, or if the patient does not have sufficient gastrointestinal tract function,

parenteral nutrition support would be indicated.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

Question 77

Which function does protein perform that is essential during the postoperative period?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| Wound healing
rv] m| Proper bone formation
rv] | Infection prevention
rv] mw] Blood volume maintenance
rv] | Transportation of fat through circulation
I °
That's right!
Rationale

It is important for patients to consume optimal amounts of protein during the postoperative period.
Immediately following major surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass graft, the body tissues undergo
considerable catabolism. In addition to protein lost from the breakdown of tissue, other losses of protein may
occur. During wound healing, a patient’s dietary protein needs increase to restore lost protein and to build
new tissues at the wound site. Protein and minerals are essential to the foundation of bone formation. Protein
is a major component of the body’s immune system. An adequate supply of the plasma protein albumin is
necessary to maintain blood volume. Protein is necessary to transport fat through circulation to all tissues and
to the liver for metabolism.

pp. 414-415
Question 78

A patient is scheduled to have bariatric surgery. Which dietary restriction would the nurse

communicate to the patient before the surgery?
@ @ Fiber-restricted diet

O Protein-restricted diet
O Saturated fat-restricted diet

O Carbohydrate-restricted diet

That's right!

Rationale

The health care team often recommends a fiber-restricted diet several days before gastrointestinal surgery to
clear the surgical site of food residue. Every surgical patient should be equipped with adequate body protein
to counteract blood loss during surgery and prevent tissue catabolism. Carbohydrates and fats are necessary

before surgery when patients need protein to build and repair tissue.

pp. 412-414
Question 79

A patient is scheduled for abdominal surgery in the morning and is informed that eating
and drinking before surgery is prohibited. Which amount of time is required to remain

without food or drink before surgery?

@ © Bhours
O 4hours
O 2Zhours
O 6 hours

That's right!

Rationale

Nothing should be taken orally for at least 8 hours before a surgical procedure. Abstaining from food and
drink 2, 4, or 6 hours before surgery would not be adequate to ensure that food is not retained in the
stomach. The presence of food in the stomach during surgery may cause complications, such as aspiration

during anesthesia or vomiting after the procedure.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices

will seem like the correct response.

pp. 413-414
Question 80

Which type of nutritional therapy is recommended for patients after a hemorrhoidectomy
to reduce painful elimination and allow healing?

rv) © Nonresidue commercial elemental formulas

O Regular diet
O High-fiber diet

O Parenteral nutrition feedings

That's right!

Rationale

For a brief period after rectal surgery or hemorrhoidectomy, clear fluid or fiber-restricted diets help to reduce
painful elimination and allow for healing. Nonresidue commercial elemental formulas help delay bowel
movements until the surgical area has healed. Regular or high-fiber diets are not recommended for patients
following a hemorrhoidectomy. Parenteral nutrition specifically refers to the feeding of nutrients directly into

the blood circulation through certain veins (e.g., a peripheral vein in the arm or the subclavian vein).

p. 430
Question 81

Intake of which nutrient needs to be reduced to facilitate patient recovery after gallbladder

surgery?
O Carbohydrates

O Calcium

O Vitamin C

rv) © Fats

That's right!

Rationale

After surgery, reducing fat in the diet (e.g., less than 30% of total energy intake as fat) facilitates wound
healing and comfort. The hormonal stimulus for bile continues to function, thus causing pain with the high
intake of fatty foods. Carbohydrates, calcium, and vitamin C are not metabolized by the action of bile.

p. 427
Question 82

Which type of nutrition therapy is ideal for severely debilitated patients who have had
radical neck or facial surgery?
O Oral liquid feeding

O Mechanical soft diet

rv) © Enteral tube feeding
O Regular diet

That's right!

Rationale

Severely debilitated patients who have had radical neck or facial surgery may benefit from tube feedings. For
long-term needs, enteral feeding equipment and standardized commercial formulas have made it possible to
continue enteral nutrition at home. Oral liquid feeding, mechanical soft diets, and regular diets are not ideal

for severely debilitated patients who have had radical neck or facial surgery.

p. 426
Question 83

Which vein(s) is used to deliver nutrient solutions of <900 mOsm/L in parenteral nutrition?

©) Subclavian vein
@ ©@ Smaller peripheral veins
O Superior vena cava

O Inferior vena cava

That's right!

Rationale
Parenteral nutrition is appropriate for use when a solution of <900 mOsm/L is enough to provide nutrient
needs. Small peripheral veins, usually in the arm, deliver the less-concentrated solutions. Subclavian vein,

superior vena cava, and inferior vena cava are not used for peripheral nutrition.

p.424
Question 84

Which equipment is used in continuous feedings?

O Intravenous catheter
O Syringe pumps

@ ©@ Feeding pump
© Gravity drip

That's right!

Rationale

Continuous feeding is an enteral feeding schedule whereby formula is infused via a feeding pump over a 24-
hour period. An intravenous catheter is used for parenteral nutrition when the patient needs full nutrition
support for longer periods. The surgeon will place the catheter into a large central vein (usually the subclavian
vein). A syringe or gravity drip is used for bolus feedings, which involve the administration of enteral nutrition

over a few minutes, given in several feedings per day.

p. 422
Question 85

Which route is recommended for long-term enteral feedings?

Cy) O Enterostomy
tx} © Nasogastric

O Nasoduodenal

O Nasojejunal

So close!

Rationale

For long-term feedings, an enterostomy (i.e., the surgical placement of the tube at progressive points along
the gastrointestinal tract) provides a more comfortable route. If a patient requires enteral tube feeding for a
short time (less than 4 weeks), a feeding tube is usually inserted into the stomach through the nose
(nasogastric). For patients who are at risk for aspiration, reflux, or continual vomiting, a nasoduodenal or

nasojejunal tube may be more appropriate.

p. 419
Question 86

Which type of food is included in a clear liquid hospital diet?
@ ©@ Foods that are transparent liquid at body temperature and require minimal digestion

©) Foods that would melt at room temperature
©) Foods that are blended

O Foods of all textures

That's right!

Rationale

A clear liquid diet consists of foods that are transparent liquid at body temperature and require minimal
digestion. A full-liquid diet contains anything that would melt at room temperature and is used only
temporarily during recovery. A mechanically altered diet consists of foods that are easy to swallow (i.e., they
are blended, chopped, ground, or mashed). A regular house diet consists of foods of all textures, taken when

the patient has no difficulty chewing or swallowing.

p. 420
Question 87

Which criterion is considered for selecting central parenteral nutrition support therapy?

© Functional gastrointestinal tract

@ ©@ Long-term therapy needed
© Need for bowel rest

© Length of therapy of up to 14 days

That's right!

Rationale

Central parenteral nutrition support is considered when long-term therapy is needed. Enteral nutrition
support Is indicated for patients with enough functional gastrointestinal tract to allow adequate digestion and
absorption. Parenteral nutrition support is considered when there is a need for bowel rest (e.g., enteral
fistulas, acute inflammatory bowel disease). Peripheral parenteral nutrition is indicated when the length of

therapy is short, usually up to 14 days.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

p. 418
Question 88

A health care provider is determining the most appropriate form of nutrition for a patient
after bone marrow transplantation. Which cue indicates that it would be appropriate for a

patient to receive central parenteral nutrition?

© @ The patient is not hypermetabolic.
@ © The patient has poor peripheral access.
© The patient has a fluid restriction.

© The length of therapy is expected to be less than 10 days.

So close!

Rationale

The term parenteral nutrition refers to any feeding method not involving the gastrointestinal tract. Central
parenteral nutrition is appropriate when the energy and nutrient requirement is large or when the patient
needs full nutrition support for longer periods. If a patient has poor peripheral access, central parenteral
nutrition would be recommended. For central parenteral nutrition to be appropriate, the patient would be
hypermetabolic, the patient would not have a fluid restriction, and the expected course of therapy would
exceed 14 days.

pp. 418, 424
Question 89

The nurse is caring for a patient recovering from an extensive surgery. Which oral clinical
diet would be ordered for this patient?

O High-fat, high-kilocalorie

O Low-protein, decreased-kilocalorie
rv) © High-protein, increased-kilocalorie

O Fluid restriction, increased-potassium

That's right!

Rationale

If a patient has had extensive surgery, a high-protein, increased-kilocalorie diet is needed to meet the
increased demands of healing. A high-fat, high-kilocalorie diet would be ordered for a patient who needs to
gain weight. Protein should not be low because this can hinder wound healing. Fluids should be increased in

a patient recovering from extensive surgery.

p.415
Question 90

Which enteral feeding route poses the highest risk for aspiration?

Cy) © Nasogastric
O Jejunostomy
©) Nasoducdenal

O Gastrostomy

That's right!

Rationale
The nasogastric route poses the greatest risk for aspiration. Jejunostomy poses no risk for aspiration. The

nasoduodenal route and the gastrostomy tube pose a lower risk for aspiration than the nasogastric route.

p. 418
Question 91

The catheter used for central parenteral nutrition (PN) is placed in which vessel?

© Cephalic artery

© Basilic artery
© Metacarpal vein

Cy) © Subclavian vein

That's right!

Rationale
For central PN, the catheter is placed in a large-diameter vein such as the subclavian vein. Central PN

catheters are not placed in arteries, and the metacarpal vein is too small for a central PN catheter.

p.424
Question 92

Which factor is the primary consideration when selecting the peripheral route for parenteral
nutrition?

O Patient’s disease state
rv) © Osmolality of the solution
O Duration of infusion administration

O Frequency of nutrition administration

That's right!

Rationale

The osmolality of the solution is the primary consideration when choosing the peripheral access route for
administration of parenteral nutrition. A higher osmolality solution is a reflection of the concentration of its
total particles. Small peripheral veins, usually in the arm, are used to deliver less concentrated solutions (900
mOsm/L or less). The patient’s disease state, duration of nutrition infusion administration, and frequency of
nutritional administration are taken into consideration, but the osmolality of the solution requires specific

access routes making it the primary consideration.

p.424
Question 93

Which dietary change is an example of texture being modified?
@ ©@ Clear liquid to regular

©, Low sodium to regular
© High potassium to low potassium
©, 1500 kcal/day to 2000 kcal/day

That's right!

Rationale
The texture of a diet is changed when going from clear liquids to a regular diet. The texture will not change

with changes in sodium, potassium, or calorie intake.

p. 418
Question 94

When a patient is preparing for elective surgery, which nutritional need should be the

focus? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Restricted fluids

rv) | Increased protein

rv) m| Adequate vitamins

Decreased calcium

rv) mw) Sufficient kilocalories

That's right!

Rationale

When a patient has elective surgery, nutrient stores should be built up to prepare for surgery and promote
recovery. Nutrient stores to build up include protein, vitamins, and kilocalories. Dehydration may occur if
fluids are restricted. Calcium is essential for mineral bone density and should not be decreased.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 412
Question 95

Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition for which reason? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Is less invasive

| Is less expensive

Allows the gut to rest

rv) m| Preserves gut function

| Decreases risk factors

That's right!

Rationale

Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it is less invasive, is less expensive, preserves
gut function, and decreases risk factors. Enteral nutrition does not allow the gut to rest; the nutrition is

delivered directly into the gastrointestinal tract.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 418
Question 96

The nurse receives an order to initiate enteral nutrition via a nasogastric (NG) tube for a
patient with a bowel obstruction. Which action should the nurse take?

O Initiate the enteral feeding at a lower rate.
O Initiate the enteral feeding at the ordered rate.
rv) © Discuss the order with the health care provider.
O Verify placement of the NG tube before the feeding.

That's right!

Rationale

When receiving an order to initiate enteral nutrition via an NG tube for a patient with bowel obstruction, the
nurse should discuss the order with the health care provider because enteral nutrition is contraindicated for a
patient with a bowel obstruction. The nurse does not have the legal right to change an order but does have a
legal obligation to protect the patient from harm. The enteral feeding should not be administered; therefore
initiation at a lower rate or the ordered rate and verification of the NG tube placement before feeding are not

necessary.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p. 419
Question 97

The nurse is caring for a patient who is not at risk for aspiration and requires long-term
enteral nutritional therapy. Which procedure does the nurse anticipate for accessing a safe

nutritional route?

O Enterostomy

© Esophagostomy

O Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy

Cy) © Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy

That's right!

Rationale

A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy involves placing a tube through the abdominal wall into the stomach
and is utilized for a patient who is not at risk for aspiration. A patient who is at risk for aspiration and requires
enteral nutritional therapy will need a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy. An enterostomy is the surgical
placement of the tube at progressive points along the gastrointestinal tract. An esophagostomy is the creation
of an artificial opening in the esophagus at the level of the cervical spine and is used after head and neck
surgeries or traumatic injury.

p. 419
Question 98

What is the best route for short-term enteral therapy?

Cy) © Nasoenteric

O Enterostomy

O Nasojejunal
O Nasoduodenal

That's right!

Rationale

The most appropriate route for short-term enteral therapy is the nasoenteric route. It is passed through the
nose into the stomach or small intestine and is indicated for short-term therapy of 6 weeks or less in many
clinical situations. An enterostomy is the surgical placement of a tube and is indicated for long-term feedings.
Nasojejunal and nasoduodenal routes are types of nasoenteric feeding routes.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 419
Question 99

Which clinical situation is an indication for parenteral nutrition? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [B] Inflammatory bowel disease

M| Severe ileus

Nausea and vomiting

Severe liver failure

iV]
Cy) | Bowel obstruction
iV]

So close!

Rationale

Severe inflammatory bowel disease, severe ileus, bowel obstruction, and severe liver failure are indications for
parenteral nutrition, which is administered intravenously. Nausea and vomiting, on their own, do not indicate
parenteral nutrition.

Question 1
—

Which organ can undergo atrophy due to malnutrition and compromise immunity? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Bowel wall

| Spleen

Lymphoid tissue

Bone marrow

Lung

So close!

Rationale

Severe malnutrition compromises the capacity of the immune system because of atrophy of the organs and
tissues that are involved in immunity (e.g., liver, bowel wall, bone marrow, spleen, lymphoid tissue). The lung

does not atrophy due to poor nutrition.

p. 436
Question 2
—

Which ethnicity or race has the highest incidence of cancer in the United States?

tx} © African American

Cy) O White

So close!

Rationale

The incidence of cancer in the United States is highest among the White population, followed by American

Indian, African American, Mexican, Hispanic, and Asian populations.

Test-Taking Tip: Because few things in life are absolute without exceptions, avoid selecting answers that

include words such as always, never, all, every, and none. Answers containing these key words are rarely correct.

p. 435
Question 3
—

Which risk factor causes the largest percentage of new HIV infections each year?

tx} © Intravenous drug use
Cy) O Male-to-male sexual contact

© High-risk heterosexual activity

© Individuals may be unaware of their infection

So close!

Rationale

The largest percentage of new HIV infections each year is related to male-to male sexual contact. Intravenous
drug use is a common cause of HIV infections related to transmission via used needles, but this does not
cause the largest percentage of new HIV infections each year. Although not the cause of the largest
percentage of new HIV infections, high-risk heterosexual activity is also a risk factor. Many individuals are not
aware that they are living with HIV; therefore, transmission can occur without them knowing; however, this
does not cause the largest percentage of new HIV infections each year.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times, the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful
hints."

p. 445
Question 4
—

Intake of which food is associated with the risk for cancer? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Processed meat
Lean protein
Legumes
Whole grains

rv) m| Red meat

rv) mw) Alcohol

That's right!

Rationale

Diets high in processed meat or red meat cooked at high temperatures increase the risk for colorectal and
stomach cancer. A general consensus is that obesity and a poor diet (i-e., low intake of fruits, vegetables, whole
grains and dairy products and high intake of processed meat, red meat, and alcohol) increases cancer

incidence. Intake of lean protein, legumes, fruits, or whole grains are not known to increase the risk for

cancer.

pp. 434, 436
Question 5
a

The newly diagnosed client with HIV states, "Il feel great. Why do | need antiretroviral
therapy?" Which statement demonstrates the nurse’s understanding of treatment?

rv) © "During the incubation period, the virus continues to multiply.”
O "You do not have to start taking the antiretroviral medication until you start feeling ill."
O "The earlier treatment is started, the better chance you have of being cured."

O "The drugs will stop the HIV from multiplying, and you will be fine."

That's right!

Rationale

The statement "During the incubation period, the virus continues to multiply" demonstrates understanding of
the purpose of antiretroviral therapy. During the incubation period, the virus hides in lymphoid tissues, where
it rapidly multiplies as part of its parasitic lifestyle within the host, taking over more of the host’s CD4+T cells
and gaining strength. The incubation period is a critical period for early medical treatment and intervention,
which includes taking antiretroviral drugs even if the client does not feel ill. The drugs will not cure the client

with HIV or stop the HIV virus from multiplying, but they will slow down viral replication.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging, because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will

seem like the correct response.

p. 446
Question 6
Es

Which problem may cause patients undergoing cancer treatment to develop compromised

outcomes?

rv) © Suboptimal nutrition status
O Increased metabolism
O Small and frequent feedings
O Increased fluid intake

That's right!

Rationale

Individuals entering cancer treatment with suboptimal nutrition status have compromised outcomes (e.g.,
longer hospital stays, increased infection risk, increased mortality). Although increased metabolism may be a
side effect of cancer treatment and results in increased nutrient and energy needs, it does not necessarily
affect outcomes. Small and frequent feedings may ease gastrointestinal discomfort and do not have an effect
on compromised outcomes. Maintaining adequate fluid balance is essential to replace gastrointestinal losses
from fever, infection, vomiting, or diarrhea; therefore increased fluid intake would not result in compromised
outcomes.

p. 436
Question 7
Es

Which stage of carcinogenesis is the point at which a mutagen causes irreversible damage
to the DNA?

rv) O Initiation

O Promotion
O Progression

x) © Mutation

So close!

Rationale

Initiation is the point at which a mutagen causes irreversible damage to the DNA. There are three phases of
carcinogenesis: initiation, promotion, and progression. An agent that prompts the mutated cell to grow and
reproduce initiates the promotion phase. Progression is the phase during which the cancer cells advance and
become a malignant tumor that is capable of metastasizing. A mutation may disrupt the orderly process of cell
division, particularly when the mutation occurs in a regulatory gene, but is not a stage of carcinogenesis.

p. 434
Question &

Nutrition counseling for patients with HIV/AIDS is based on which basic goal?
© Change diet completely

© Increase fat intake
@ ©@ Minimum changes to food patterns

© Decrease fiber or roughage intake

That's right!

Rationale

The basic goal of nutrition counseling is to make the least number of changes necessary in a person’s lifestyle
and food patterns to promote optimal nutrition status while providing maximal comfort and quality of life.
Changing the diet completely would not be sustainable. Increasing the fat intake and decreasing the fiber
intake are not basic goals of nutrition counseling for patients with HIV/AIDS.

p. 450
Question 9
|

For which group is early detection of HIV recommended, according to current HIV

screening guidelines? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

tx} | Infants

Children age 5 to 10 years

Cy) ndividuals age 15 to 65 years

Athletes

Cy) | Pregnant women

So close!

Rationale

Current HIV screening guidelines recommend HIV testing for all individuals age 15 to 65 years, all pregnant
women, and others deemed high risk or who request testing. The current HIV screening guidelines do not

specifically recommend early detection of HIV in infants, children age 5 to 10 years, and athletes.

p. 447
Question 10

Which dietary suggestion can help manage the cancer treatment side effects of nausea and

vomiting? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Avoid greasy foods.

Cy) Avoid sweets.

Ensure food is very warm.

@ [BB] Eat dry foods.

Eat spicy foods.

So close!

Rationale

Avoiding greasy foods and sweets is suggested to manage the side effects of cancer treatment such as
vomiting and nausea. Eating dry foods is also suggested. Very warm food is not suggested since cold and

room temperature foods may be better tolerated. It is suggested that spicy foods also be avoided to avoid such
side effects.

p. 439
Question 11

Which is the best dietary recommendation for a client diagnosed with HIV infection?
© High-calorie diet

© © High-protein diet

@ © ‘Standard dietary recommendations
© High-carbohydrate diet

So close!

Rationale

There are no specific dietary recommendations for a client diagnosed with HIV infection other than meeting
their general dietary needs. Dietary changes such as high-calorie, high-protein, or high-carbohydrate diets
aim to reduce or eliminate malnutrition (if the risk is present) and to correct any other nutritional problems
identified in the nutritional assessment.

p. 450
Question 12

Which characteristic of HIV best describes its parasitic nature?

© It contains only DNA.
O It does not need a host to live.

© Ithas a complex large packet of genetic information.

@ ©@ It replicates within the host’s cells.

That's right!

Rationale

HIV’s parasitic nature is evidenced by its replication within the host’s cells. HIV contains two copies of single-
stranded RNA, which are copied into DNA. The DNA enters the T-helper cells and begins to control them. HIV
can only live through a host that it invades and infects, and the virus hijacks the host’s cell machinery to
replicate, making a multitude of copies of themselves. Viruses do not have complex large packets of genetic
information; they only contain a small chromosome of nucleic acids (RNA or DNA), usually with fewer than

five genes.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 445
Question 13

The result of a client’s computed tomography scan reveals a pulmonary neoplasm. Which is
the nurse’s interpretation of the result?

rv) © The client has a new, abnormal cellular growth in the lungs.
O The client has an overabundance of plasma.
O The client has no indication of pulmonary disease.

O The client’s lung tissue is immature.

That's right!

Rationale

A pulmonary neoplasm means the client has a new, abnormal cellular growth in the lungs. An overabundance
of plasma cells is termed multiple myeloma. A neoplasm is an abnormal process, so the computed tomography
scan does show pulmonary disease. Premature babies can be plagued with hyaline membrane disease, which

means the baby has immature lung tissue.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 436
Question 14

Which elements does the nurse know are the immune system’s primary "search-and-
destroy" defense against potential disease?

O Hemoglobin and platelets
O Monocytes and erythrocytes
rv) © T cells and B cells

O Lymphocytes and megakaryocytes

That's right!

Rationale

T cells and B cells are the immune system’s primary "search-and-destroy" defense against potential disease. A
major function of T cells is to activate phagocytes, which are the cells that destroy invaders and kill disease-
carrying antigens. A major function of B cells is to produce antibodies, which also kill antigens. Hemoglobin is
a protein in red blood cells that contains iron and transports oxygen. Platelets play a role in clotting.
Monocytes are phagocytic white blood cells, and erythrocytes are red blood cells. A lymphocyte is a type of
white blood cell; the two main types are T cells and B cells, but megakaryocytes are large bone marrow cells
responsible for the production of platelets.

p. 436
Question 15

Current research indicates an increased risk for cancer in individuals who consume diets
high in which two substances?

O Processed meat and whole grains
O Fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages
O Lean meats and salty foods

rv) © Processed meat and alcohol

That's right!

Rationale

Current research indicates that there is an increased risk for cancer associated with diets that are high in
processed meat, alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meat. Some studies have found that whole
grains, fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and protein help protect against cancer.

p. 436
Question 16

Which potential change in a client’s body fat can occur during therapy with nucleoside

reverse transcriptase inhibitors?

x) © Lipodystrophy
O Lipohypertrophy

rv) O Lipoatrophy

O Hyperlipidemia

So close!

Rationale

A client treated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is at risk for lipoatrophy, which is a reduction
in body fat. Lipodystrophy is abnormal fat redistribution associated with metabolic abnormalities and an
increased risk for chronic conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance.
Lipohypertrophy occurs with the use of protease inhibitors and causes an increase in the fat mass around the
abdomen and the back of the neck. Hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by abnormally elevated levels
of fats or lipids in the blood.

p. 449
Question 17

What is the basic goal of nutritional counseling for the client diagnosed with HIV infection?
© ©@ 10 prevent lipodystrophy

O To initiate supplementation
© To delay progression of the infection

@ © To make the least amount of changes necessary

So close!

Rationale

The basic goal of nutritional counseling for the client with HIV is to make the least amount of changes
necessary in the person’s lifestyle and food patterns to promote optimal nutritional status while providing
maximal comfort and quality of life. Lipodystrophy results from the use of antiretroviral therapy and metabolic
changes; diet cannot prevent it. Immediate supplementation is not necessary for every client diagnosed with
HIV. Antiretroviral drugs are used to delay the progression of the infection, whereas nutrition is used to
support body functions.

p. 450
Question 18

Which protocol would be explained to the client about curing lipodystrophy resulting from
antiretroviral therapy?
@ @ No interventions have been identified.

O Follow a heart-healthy diet.
O Incorporate exercise.

O Administer cholesterol-lowering medication.

That's right!

Rationale

that occurs in individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy. A heart-healthy diet and exercise are
recommended because they are key interventions to help manage the problems associated with lipodystrophy.

Cholesterol-lowering medication may help with hyperlipidemia but will not cure lipodystrophy.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid looking for an answer pattern or code. There may be times when four or five
consecutive questions have the same letter or number for the correct answer.

p. 449
Question 19

Which organ can undergo atrophy due to malnutrition and compromise immunity? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Bowel wall

Spleen

a
m| Lymphoid tissue
a

Bone marrow

Lung

That's right!

Rationale

Severe malnutrition compromises the capacity of the immune system because of atrophy of the organs and
tissues that are involved in immunity (e.g., liver, bowel wall, bone marrow, spleen, lymphoid tissue). The lung

does not atrophy due to poor nutrition.

Question 20

Which ethnicity or race has the highest incidence of cancer in the United States?

O African American

Cy) © White

That's right!

Rationale

The incidence of cancer in the United States is highest among the White population, followed by American

Indian, African American, Mexican, Hispanic, and Asian populations.

Test-Taking Tip: Because few things in life are absolute without exceptions, avoid selecting answers that

include words such as always, never, all, every, and none. Answers containing these key words are rarely correct.

p. 435
Question 21

Which risk factor causes the largest percentage of new HIV infections each year?

O Intravenous drug use
Cy) © Male-to-male sexual contact
© High-risk heterosexual activity

© Individuals may be unaware of their infection

That's right!

Rationale

The largest percentage of new HIV infections each year is related to male-to male sexual contact. Intravenous
drug use is a common cause of HIV infections related to transmission via used needles, but this does not
cause the largest percentage of new HIV infections each year. Although not the cause of the largest
percentage of new HIV infections, high-risk heterosexual activity is also a risk factor. Many individuals are not
aware that they are living with HIV; therefore, transmission can occur without them knowing; however, this

does not cause the largest percentage of new HIV infections each year.

Test-Taking Tip: Many times, the correct answer is the longest alternative given, but do not count on it. Item
writers (those who write the questions) are also aware of this and attempt to avoid offering you such "helpful

hints."

p. 445
Question 22

A client’s initial HIV test is indeterminate but 6 months later comes back positive. Using the

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system for HIV, in which stage of
HIV is this client?

So close!

Rationale

The client is in stage 0 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system.
Stage 0 is defined as an “early HIV infection, inferred from a negative or indeterminate HIV test result within 6
months of a confirmed positive test." Clients are categorized as being in stages 1, 2, and 3 based on their
CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and symptomatic conditions.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 446
Question 23

Which action would a client with no known risk factors take to prevent contracting HIV?
© Abstain from sex.

O Get vaccinated against it.
Cy) © Take preventive measures.

© Take a prophylactic antiretroviral medication.

That's right!

Rationale

Because there is no cure for HIV at this time, prevention is the only means of protection. Because HIV is
transmitted in many different ways, abstaining from sex does not guarantee avoidance of HIV infection; it is
only one preventive measure. There are no vaccines to prevent HIV. Antiretroviral medications can be used for
HIV prophylaxis, but are reserved for pre-exposure prophylaxis in at risk clients or for post-exposure

prophylaxis.

p. 445
Question 24

Which situation results in the highest rate of HIV transmission?

Cy) © Male-to-male sexual contact
© Injection drug use
O Heterosexual contact

O Blood transfusion

That's right!

Rationale

Male-to-male sexual contact accounts for the highest rate of HIV transmission. Injection drug use is a mode
of HIV transmission, but it accounts for lower rates of transmission compared with male-to-male sexual
contact. Heterosexual contact by itself is not associated with a high rate of HIV transmission; however, female
heterosexual contact, along with male-to-male sexual contact, results in the highest rate of HIV transmission.

The rate of HIV transmission via blood transfusion is lower than that for male-to-male sexual contact.

p. 445
Question 25

Which is the most common cancer associated with AIDS in the terminal stage of HIV

infection?

O Invasive cervical cancer
O Pneumocystis
O Leukoencephalopathy

rv) © Kaposi’s sarcoma

That's right!

Rationale

The most common cancer associated with AIDS in the terminal stage of HIV infection is Kaposi’s sarcoma.
Invasive cervical cancer can occur in women but is not as common as Kaposi’s sarcoma. Pneumocystis is a
form of pneumonia rather than a cancer. Leukoencephalopathy is not a cancer; it is a deterioration of the

white matter in the brain.

p. 447
Question 26

Which is a current established goal for the medical management of HIV infection? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

| Treating infection early

Preventing opportunistic illness

a
m| Boosting the immune system
a

Using prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection

Providing high-dose radiation therapy for tumors

So close!

Rationale

Current goals for the medical management of HIV infection include recognizing and treating infection early,
preventing opportunistic illness, and boosting the immune system. Prophylactic antibiotics are not used to
prevent infection, and high-dose radiation therapy is not used for clients with HIV. Low-dose radiation or

anticancer drugs may be used to slow the spread of tumors if they occur during the disease process.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 447
Question 27

Which class of HIV antiretroviral therapy is associated with an increased risk for

lipoatrophy? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) Protease inhibitors

Integrase inhibitors

@ |B] Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors

Fusion inhibitors

C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists

So close!

Rationale

Lipoatrophy is a side effect of treatment with protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. Integrase inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, and CCR5 antagonists are associated with other side effects,

not lipoatrophy.

p. 449
Question 28

Which factor in a client’s history increases the risk for the development of cancer? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Body mass index of 23 kg/m 2

Supportive family

m| Smokes one pack of cigarettes per day

Sedentary lifestyle

| States, "| hate vegetables."

Eats 2.5 cups of fruit per day

That's right!

Rationale

Factors that increase the risk for developing cancer include smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor fruit
and/or vegetable intake. Obesity is a risk factor for cancer development, but the client’s body mass index is
within normal limits, so this is not a risk factor. A supportive family decreases the effects of stress and creates

no increased risk for cancer. Consumption of 2.5 cups of fruit daily is the recommended daily requirement, so

this does not increase this client’s risk for cancer.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 435
Question 29

Which side effect is reported by patients with HIV who take antiretroviral medications?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) ™| Nausea

| Altered taste

Increased appetite

| Diarrhea

oO
Cy) Hyperglycemia
oO

So close!

Rationale

Antiretroviral medications have multiple side effects, including nausea, altered taste, hyperglycemia, and
diarrhea. Increased appetite is not a known side effect of using antiretroviral medications.

p. 447
Question 30

Which risk is associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by

patients with cancer? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

lm] CAM has not been proven to be effective in cancer.

| Some restrictive diets cause nutrient deficiencies.

Patients often do not disclose information about the use of CAM.

Results of clinical experimentation have not proven that CAM is safe.

| Dietary supplements can have dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs.

So close!

Rationale

Many CAM practices have undergone clinical experimentation and failed to produce any positive or cancer-
protective results. Experts discourage the use of macrobiotic diets for cancer prevention because of the
restrictive nature of the diet and the risk for multiple nutrient deficiencies. Patients often feel uncomfortable
discussing their CAM practices with their health care provider, which could result in serious consequences.
Clinical experimentation has determined that some CAM practices are not safe in patients with cancer. Dietary
supplements can have dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs and reduce the effectiveness of
chemotherapy.

Test-Taking Tip: Monitor questions that you answer with an educated guess or changed your answer from the
first option you selected. This will help you to analyze your ability to think critically. Usually your first answer is

correct and should not be changed without reason.

p. 444
Question 31

Which intervention would be best for a client with HIV who is experiencing nausea and
vomiting?

O "Try new foods when feeling your best."

O "Use plastic utensils if food tastes metallic."

rv) © "Remain upright at least 1 hour after eating.”
O “Avoid dry and bland foods."

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse can suggest that the client remain upright for at least 1 hour after eating to help alleviate nausea
and vomiting. Trying new foods when the client is feeling their best and using plastic utensils if the food tastes
metallic are recommendations for the client experiencing taste and smell alterations. Dry, bland, easy to
digest foods are preferable to clients with nausea and vomiting. Avoiding greasy foods, spicy foods, sweets, or

foods with strong odors is a recommendation for clients experiencing nausea.

p. 439
Question 32

Which clinical assessment finding does the nurse anticipate will affect nutritional

counseling for a client with HIV-associated xerostomia?

rv) © Dry mouth

O Inflammation of the mouth
O Taste and smell alterations

O Inflamed mucous membranes in the lining in the digestive system

That's right!

Rationale

Xerostomia is dry mouth, so the nutritional counseling will include suggestions to keep the mouth moist and
stimulate the salivary glands. Stomatitis is inflammation of the mouth. Xerostomia does not cause alterations
in taste and smell. Mucositis is pain and inflammation of the mucous membranes in the lining of the

digestive system.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem that are the same or similar in nature to those in one or two
of the options .

p. 439
Question 33

Malnutrition causes which process that decreases a cancer client’s immunity?

©) Loss of fluid from the gastrointestinal system
@ © Atrophy of organs and tissues
© Excess production of gastric acid

© Increased production of white blood cells

That's right!

Rationale

Atrophy of the organs and tissues involved in immunity, such as the liver, bowel, bone marrow, spleen, and
lymph, compromises the integrity of the immune system. Loss of fluid from the gastrointestinal tract can
result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Clients usually suffer from metabolic alkalosis (not excess
gastric acid) when vomiting. Increased production of white blood cells indicates inflammation or infection,

and this client does not necessarily have an inflammatory condition or infection.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice questions.
If you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 436
Question 34

Which nutritional intervention may preserve gut functioning and help reduce inflammation
in clients with HIV who are experiencing severe diarrhea and malabsorption due to

intestinal tissue damage?

© Lipid-based nutritional supplements
© The Mediterranean diet

O Increased micronutrients

Cy) © Probiotics

That's right!

Rationale

Probiotics and prebiotics may be beneficial for preserving gut functioning and reducing inflammation in
some clients. A lipid-based nutritional supplement with added soy or whey protein initiated early in
antiretroviral therapy may help prevent lean tissue loss and, in some cases, muscle wasting. The
Mediterranean diet is a heart-healthy diet recommended for clients receiving antiretroviral therapy, but it does
not preserve gut functioning. Micronutrients are substances that are required by the body for normal growth
and development, but they cannot be absorbed properly if the integrity of the intestinal lining is damaged.

p. 448
Question 35

A patient with cancer has a white blood cell count of 2.1 x 10 °/L. Which dietary
modification would be recommended to prevent infection?

O Take zinc supplements.
O Rinse the mouth before and after eating.
rv) © Avoid salad bars and buffets when eating out.

O Avoid greasy foods, hot and cold liquids, caffeine, and foods high in sugar alcohols.

That's right!

Rationale

To decrease the chance of getting an infection, patients with compromised immunity (e.g., patients with
cancer or HIV-positive patients with decreased white blood cell counts) would be advised to avoid salad bars
and buffets when eating out to reduce the risk for ingesting contaminated foods. This is considered a
neutropenic diet. The nurse would rule out zinc deficiency for alterations in taste and smell. Patients would be
advised to rinse the mouth before and after eating to avoid nausea and vomiting. The nurse would advise
patients to avoid greasy foods, hot and cold liquids, caffeine, and foods high in sugar alcohols to avoid
diarrhea.

p. 439
Question 36

Which general complication of chemotherapy results in the need for nutrition
management?

O Drug-nutrient interactions
rv) © Interference with the function of the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract
O Damaged oral mucosa

O Alterations in sensitivity to food temperatures

That's right!

Rationale

Nausea, vomiting, loss of taste, anorexia, and mucositis are some of the problems that patients experience
when the function of the Gl tract is affected by chemotherapy and result in the need for nutrition
management. Drug-nutrient interactions can occur when a patient uses supplements and herbs while being
treated with medications; this may adversely affect patients or their treatment regimen but does not require
nutritional management. Damaged oral mucosa and alterations in taste sensitivity to food temperatures are

complications of radiation therapy and not typically seen with chemotherapy.

p. 437
Question 37

In which Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV clinical category does a client

diagnosed with HIV infection begin to become symptomatic?
O Category A

rv) © Category B
O Category C
O Category D

That's right!

Rationale

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s clinical classification system for HIV, the client
with clinical category B HIV begins to become symptomatic. This is a period marked by opportunistic illnesses
because, at this point, the HIV infection has killed enough host-protective T lymphocytes to severely damage
the immune system and lower the body’s normal resistance to disease. Category A is an asymptomatic period
during which the client may have mild flu-like symptoms 2 to 4 weeks after infection. Typically, the client feels
well for a number of years following this. Category C is the terminal stage of HIV infection, during which
there is a rapid decline in T-lymphocyte counts and the presence of opportunistic illness. There is no category
D.

p. 447
Question 38

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system for HIV,

which client is considered to have AIDS?

x) © A client in category B with any stage 2 CD4+ T-lymphocyte count

O A client in category A with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 500 cells/yiL or more
rv) O A client in category C with any stage 3 CD4+ T-lymphocyte count

O A client in category B with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 200-499 cells/yL

So close!

Rationale

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system for HIV, a client is
considered to have AIDS if they are in clinical category C with any stage 3 CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. A client
in clinical category B is considered to have AIDS only if the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is in stage 3 (more than
200 cells/uL). A client in category A with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 500 cells/piL or more is not considered
to have AIDS. The CD4+ T lymphocyte count is a stage 1 count. The client in category B with a CD4+ T
lymphocyte count of 200-499 cells/yL is not considered to have AIDS.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 447
Question 39

Which dietary modification would be made for a client receiving chemotherapy who is
suffering from stomatitis?

O "Do not use a straw to drink fluids."
rv) © "Numb the mouth with ice chips or flavored ice pops."
O "Eat foods that are firm with a coarse texture."

O “Avoid gravies, broths, or sauces."

That's right!

Rationale

The client would benefit from numbing the mouth with ice chips or flavored ice pops to lessen the oral
discomfort. The client should use a straw to drink fluids. Soft foods that are easy to chew, not firm foods with
a coarse texture, should be recommended, Gravies, broths, and sauces can be used to moisten food and help

ease pain associated with chewing.

p. 439
Question 40
|

Which suggestion would a nurse make to help improve the nutritional intake of a client
with HIV who is experiencing anorexia? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

Eat foods that are soft and easy to chew and swallow.

Drink most fluids between meals.

| Choose foods that appeal to the sense of smell.

| Arrange for help with purchasing and preparing foods.

Consume one-third of the daily protein requirements and calories at dinner.

That's right!

Rationale

Some suggestions a nurse can make to help improve nutritional intake for a client with HIV who is
experiencing anorexia include choosing foods that appeal to the sense of smell and arranging for help with
purchasing and preparing foods to help conserve energy. Eating foods that are soft and easy to chew and
swallow is recommended for a client experiencing mucositis or stomatitis. Drinking most fluids between
meals is recommended for the client experiencing dehydration. It is recommended that a client experiencing
anorexia consume one-third of their daily protein and calories at breakfast rather than at dinner.

p. 439
Question 41

Which phase of carcinogenesis is the point at which cell mutation occurs? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

O ncidence
rv) © nitiation
O Metastasis

O Promotion

O Progression

That's right!

Rationale

Initiation is the point at which a mutagen causes irreversible damage to the DNA. The promotion phase is
when the mutated cell is prompted to grow and reproduce. The phase during which cancer cells advance and
become malignant is the progression phase. Incidence is not a phase of carcinogenesis; it is the term used to
describe the prevalence of cancer relative to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic characteristics. Metastasis is the
term used when cancer has spread from the primary source to other tissue in the body; metastasis occurs

during the progression phase.

p. 434
Question 42

Which is an appropriate recommendation for a client who is having difficulty chewing and

swallowing? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Eat small, frequent meals.

Choose firm, textured foods.

™| Add gravies or sauces to moisten food.

Eat and drink slowly.

Eat food cool or at room temperature.

Decrease fluid intake.

So close!

Rationale

Appropriate recommendations for a client receiving cancer therapy who is having difficulty swallowing include
eating small, frequent meals; adding gravies or sauces to moisten food; eating and drinking slowly; and eating
food cool or at room temperature. Firm, textured foods may increase difficulty swallowing. It is recommended
that clients with difficulty swallowing should increase fluid intake to avoid dehydration.

p. 439
Question 43

How is HIV transmitted? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | Sexual contact

M™@| Drug use

Kissing

Vd
Cy) | Organ transplantation
vd

| Sharing of needles

So close!

Rationale

HIV is transmitted via sexual contact, organ transplantation, and the sharing of needles. HIV can only be
transmitted through drug use if the use involves infected needles. HIV is not transmitted through kissing. The
virus is unable to penetrate unbroken skin and is not spread via contact with saliva.

p. 445
Question 44

When providing education to a client with HIV in clinical category B, which common

symptom should be discussed? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

| Unusual cough

Wasting syndrome

Diarrhea

Unusual bruising

Fatigue

So close!

Rationale

Some of the common symptoms that should be discussed with a client who has HIV in clinical category B
include a new or unusual cough, diarrhea, unusual bruising, and fatigue. Weight loss will occur, but wasting
syndrome is a marked change in body weight that occurs in category C, not B, infection.

p. 446
Question 45

The nurse assessing the HIV-infected client’s nutritional status uses the basic ABCDs
(anthropometry, biochemic tests, clinical observations, and dietary evaluations). Which
additional point would the nurse include in the assessment? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Cy) | Environmental
@ |B] Family support

Cy) Financial

Enteral nutrition

Fluids and electrolytes

So close!

Rationale

The nurse assessing the HIV-infected client’s nutritional status using the basic ABCDs will also include the
additional points "E" for environmental and "F" for financial to the assessment. Family support is included
under "Environmental." Enteral nutrition is not a specific element of the acronym ABCDEF assessment of the
HIV-infected client, nor are fluids and electrolytes.

p. 449
Question 46

Which clinical finding related to nutritional deficiency occurs in the advanced stages of HIV

infection? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Increased cellular function

Insufficient energy intake

Decreased appetite

Suppressed immune function

Elevated resting energy expenditure

That's right!

Rationale
Clients in the advanced stages of HIV infection regularly have insufficient energy intake, decreased appetite,
suppressed immune function, and elevated resting energy expenditure. Clients in the advanced stages of HIV

infection experience a decrease in cellular function, not increased cellular function.

Test-Taking Tip: Avoid taking a wild guess at an answer. However, should you feel insecure about a question,
eliminate the alternatives that you believe are definitely incorrect, and reread the information given to make
sure you understand the intent of the question. This approach increases your chances of randomly selecting

the correct answer or getting a clearer understanding of what is being asked.

p. 448
Question 47

In conjunction with the adverse effects of HIV infection, which contributes to the common

symptoms of diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption?

O Anorexia

rv) O Drug-—diet interactions

O Food insecurity
x) © Hypermetabolism

So close!

Rationale

Diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption result from drug—diet interactions in conjunction with the progressive
effects of HIV infection. Anorexia is a result of inadequate food intake. Food insecurity can contribute to
malnutrition, but neither anorexia nor food insecurity is directly responsible for diarrhea or nutrient

malabsorption. Hypermetabolism does not cause diarrhea or nutrient malabsorption, though it is associated
with weight loss.

p. 448
Question 48

Which is a cause of body wasting in a client with HIV? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

m| Malabsorption of nutrients

Lipoatrophy

Cachexia

Inadequate food intake

Disordered metabolism

So close!

Rationale

Body wasting in clients with HIV may result from malabsorption of nutrients, inadequate food intake, and/or
disordered metabolism. Lipoatrophy is a reduction of body fat, specifically in the limbs and face. Cachexia is

the wasting of the body itself, not a cause of it.

p. 448
Question 49

Which is a basic nutrition objective or goal of medical nutrition therapy during cancer

treatment? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Promoting weight loss for obese clients

| Maintaining tight caloric restrictions

| Maintaining lean body mass

Preventing satiety

@ |B] Identifying and managing treatment-related side effects

Preventing unintentional weight gain

So close!

Rationale

The basic nutrition objectives or goals of medical nutrition therapy include maintaining lean body mass,
identifying and managing side effects of treatment, and preventing unintentional weight gain. Promoting
weight loss for obese clients is not recommended during medical nutrition therapy because increased
metabolic demands can result in catabolism. Maintaining tight caloric restrictions is not a goal because a
balanced, nutritious diet is important to promote healing and prevent catabolism. Preventing satiety is not a

goal. Satiety describes a feeling of satisfaction or fullness following food intake.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 440
Question 50

Which dietary modification would be used for a patient experiencing gastrointestinal side

effects of chemotherapy? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Avoid unintentional weight gain.

Avoid hot, sweet, fatty, or spicy foods.

Consume small and frequent feedings.

Eat soft or liquid room temperature foods.

Gradually increase fiber and fluid intake.

Add spices, herbs, seasonings, and sauces.

So close!

Rationale

Gastrointestinal problems, like nausea and vomiting, associated with chemotherapy can be relieved by
avoiding hot, sweet, fatty, or spicy foods. Consuming small and frequent feedings also can ease discomfort.
Soft or liquid cold or room temperature foods may relieve symptoms. A patient undergoing chemotherapy
treatment would not want to avoid gaining weight; rather, they will likely experience weight loss and should
try to maintain their weight. Adding fiber and fluids to the diet can help with constipation, but this is not a
problem typically associated with chemotherapy. Although adding spices, herbs, seasonings, and sauces can
help with taste and smell alterations, it is contraindicated if patients have nausea and vomiting.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real
intent of the question.

p. 439
Question 51

Which consequence occurs with cancer-related cachexia? Select all that apply.One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Loss of function

ncreased morbidity

ncreased mortality

Poor quality of life

ncreased medical costs

So close!

Rationale

Cachexia is debilitating for patients. It can lead to overall loss of function because of nutritional deficiencies
and weight loss. Morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with cachexia because of additional hospital
admissions and increased length of stay. Poor quality of life occurs with cancer-related cachexia because the

patient loses muscle mass and loss of function. Additional hospital admissions and treatments increase the
medical costs for the patient and contribute to poor quality of life.

p. 438
Question 52

Which of the following measures best addresses cancer-related cachexia?

©) Provide aggressive medical nutrition therapy
© Use medication therapy to alleviate symptoms
© ©@ Follow the standard effective treatment for cachexia

Cy) O Alleviate the cancer and the metabolic abnormalities associated with it

So close!

Rationale

The best way to treat cancer-related cachexia is to alleviate the cancer and the metabolic abnormalities
associated with it. Aggressive medical nutrition therapy and medication therapy should be practiced by the
health care team because it is not always possible to alleviate the cancer, which is the best way to treat cancer-
related cachexia. There is no standard effective treatment for cachexia.

p. 438
Question 53

Which factor causes wasting in patients in the advanced stages of HIV? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Anorexia

mw) Diarrhea

Lipodystrophy

rv) m| Muscle disuse

ml Abnormal metabolism

So close!

Rationale

Anorexia, or loss of appetite, leading to inadequate food intake contributes to weight loss in HIV/AIDS
patients. Diarrhea is a common side effect of drug-diet interactions and HIV infection. It can lead to the
malabsorption of nutrients contributing to wasting. Lack of participation in physical activity (disuse) coupled
with systemic inflammation exacerbates muscle wasting. Abnormal metabolism alone will not cause wasting
because the elevated resting energy expenditure and decrease in physical activity offset each other. Although it
contributes to abnormal body composition of AIDS patients, the causative factor for lipodystrophy is
antiretroviral therapy; lipodystrophy is not a process that causes the characteristic body wasting seen in HIV.

p. 448
Question 54

Which diet would be appropriate for a patient with lipodystrophy?
© Low residue

O Gastrointestinal soft

O Low protein

Cy) © Mediterranean

That's right!

Rationale

Lipodystrophy is a condition associated with muscle wasting in the limbs and fat accumulation in the
abdominal area and back of the neck that sometimes affects patients with HIV infection. This redistribution of
fat is associated with metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance. A Mediterranean
diet based on vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans, and whole grains, along with daily exercise, is the most
effective treatment for this condition. Low-residue diets will not be beneficial to these patients. High protein
will assist in muscle maintenance but will not address the needs of a patient with lipodystrophy. A
gastrointestinal soft diet does not provide the fiber needed for cardiovascular health beneficial to patients with
HIV affected by lipodystrophy.

p. 449
Question 55

Which nutrition-related problem is observed in patients undergoing radiation therapy?

Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] mw] Anorexia and nausea

x) | Reduced blood cell count and anemia

x) | Interference with normal hair growth

rv] | Sensitivity to food texture and temperature

rv] | Ulcers, inflammation, obstructions, and fistulas
So close!

Rationale

Anorexia and nausea can occur when radiation treatment disturbs oral mucosa and salivary secretions,
affecting taste sensations. Radiation therapy, when used to treat cancer of the head, neck, or esophagus, also
affects taste sensations and sensitivity to food texture and temperature. Ulcers, inflammation, obstructions,
and fistulas can occur when radiation therapy is administered to the abdominal area, causing a loss of
intestinal villi and tissue breakdown. Chemotherapy, not radiation therapy, can cause disturbances of the bone
marrow, which can result in a reduced blood cell count and anemia; however, these are not nutrition-related
problems. Interference with normal hair growth and general hair loss are side effects of chemotherapy but are
not nutrition-related problems.

p. 437
Question 56

Place the stages of the disease progression of HIV/AIDS in the correct order.

Cy) 1. HIV infection occurs.

tx} 2. Viral incubation takes over the CD4 cells.

3. Development of antibodies occurs.

5. T-lymphocyte counts decline, and the criteria for a diagnosis of
AIDS is met.

rv] 4. Infectious illnesses begin to invade the body.

So close!

Rationale

After the initial exposure and infection of HIV, antibodies to the viral infection begin to develop. Then, there is
a long period of viral incubation in which the infected person typically feels well. During this time the virus
takes over CD4 cells and gains power. After the asymptomatic HIV-positive stage, associated infectious

illnesses mark the terminal stage of HIV infection, known as AIDS.

pp. 446-447
Question 57

Place the steps of a nutritional assessment for a patient with HIV in the correct order.

tx} 1. Patient is referred to a nutrition professional.

2. Use of a screening tool to establish nutritional status.

3. Typical ABCD nutritional evaluations are performed.

Environmental, behavioral, and psychologic factors are considered.

5. Financial status is evaluated.

>

So close!

Rationale

The first step in nutritional assessment for a patient with HIV is to use a screening tool, such as the Subjective
Global Assessment-HIV, to quickly and efficiently identify the risk for malnutrition. The patient is then referred
to a nutrition professional who will conduct a comprehensive nutrition assessment using the typical ABCD
nutrition evaluations. This will establish baseline information that is necessary for starting and continuing
nutrition care. HIV-infected patients may require further assessment to determine environmental, behavioral,
and psychologic situations that can affect outcomes. Financial status is also evaluated to determine the ability

to pay for needs such as medical insurance, food, enteral supplements, and vitamins and minerals.

Question 58

Which nutrition recommendation reduces the risk for breast cancer? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Consume a plant-based diet.

| Maintain regular physical activity.

Follow a diet rich in whole grains and fiber.

| Avoid red meat, processed meat, and saturated fat.

Avoid dietary supplements as the main source of nutrients.

So close!

Rationale

Consuming a plant-based diet has a strong protective association against breast cancer. Getting regular
physical activity is beneficial for reducing the risk for breast cancer because it helps reduce excess body fat. A
diet that avoids red meat, processed meat, and saturated fat is associated with protection from breast cancer.
Dietary supplements should not be used as main source of nutrients to reduce the risk for breast cancer. A
diet that is rich in whole grains and fiber can reduce the risk for colorectal cancer, but it is not beneficial in

reducing the risk for breast cancer.

p. 444
Question 59

Which recommendation for a patient’s lifestyle can reduce the risk for cancer? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Adults should limit alcohol use to two drinks daily.

Use dietary supplements to help meet nutrient needs.

| Limit the consumption of salty foods and salt-preserved foods.

Consume a healthy diet that has an emphasis on plant-based food.

™| Stay as lean as possible by balancing caloric intake with physical activity.

That's right!

Rationale

One of the main dietary recommendations to reduce a patient’s risk for cancer is to consume a healthy diet
with an emphasis on plant-based food. The consumption of salty foods and salt-preserved foods should be
limited. Staying as lean as possible by balancing caloric intake with physical activity is also important to reduce
cancer risk. If alcohol is consumed, the intake should be limited to two drinks per day for men and one drink
daily for women. Dietary supplements are not recommended to help meet nutrient needs; diet alone should

provide all necessary nutrients.

p. 443
Question 60

Which dietary modification would the nurse suggest for a patient with HIV who is

experiencing anorexia? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

| Eat foods that are soft and easy to swallow.

Participate in physical activity when possible.

Choose foods that appeal to the sense of smell.

Remain upright for at least 1 hour after eating.

Consume small and frequent meals and snacks.

Perform frequent mouth care to decrease aftertastes.

So close!

Rationale

Participating in physical activity, if possible, can help to increase appetite. Choosing foods that appeal to the
sense of smell is helpful when suffering from a loss of appetite. Regardless of hunger, small, frequent, high-
caloric meals and snacks should be consumed to help provide the body with some nutrition. Frequent mouth
care may help to relieve aftertastes that make foods unappealing. A patient who is experiencing anorexia
should choose foods that are appealing, regardless of the consistency. Remaining upright for 1 hour after

eating may help with nausea and vomiting but has no effect on anorexia.

p. 439
Question 61

Which nutrition intervention is included in the plan of care for patients with cancer? Select

all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

x) m| Always consider enteral or parenteral nutrition support.

rv] | Prevent nutrient deficiencies and unintentional weight loss.

rv] | Maintain tolerance to treatment, immune function, and quality of life.

rv] | Maintain or improve lean body mass, strength, energy, and functional ability.

rv] | Identify and manage nutrition-related side effects of cancer and treatment modalities.
So close!

Rationale

Preventing nutrient deficiencies and unintentional weight loss is an important intervention when developing a
plan of care for patients with cancer and can be controlled by continually updating according to the patient
status. It is important for the cancer patient to maintain tolerance to treatment, immune function, and quality
of life by appropriate methods offered by the health care professional. Patients with cancer should maintain or
improve lean body mass, strength, energy, and functional ability; this need should be carefully considered
when developing a plan of care. Side effects from cancer and its treatment should be carefully monitored and
controlled by making changes to the nutrition intervention plan. Enteral or parenteral nutrition support
should be considered if the patient is unable to tolerate normal intake of food, but it should only be used if

the nutrition status continues to decline.

p. 440
Question 62

Which is an appropriate recommendation for a client who is having difficulty chewing and

swallowing? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Eat small, frequent meals.

Choose firm, textured foods.

m| Add gravies or sauces to moisten food.

Eat and drink slowly.

m| Eat food cool or at room temperature.

Decrease fluid intake.

That's right!

Rationale

Appropriate recommendations for a client receiving cancer therapy who is having difficulty swallowing include
eating small, frequent meals; adding gravies or sauces to moisten food; eating and drinking slowly; and eating
food cool or at room temperature. Firm, textured foods may increase difficulty swallowing. It is recommended

that clients with difficulty swallowing should increase fluid intake to avoid dehydration.

p. 439
Question 63

How is HIV transmitted? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Cy) | Sexual contact

Drug use

Kissing

Cy) | Organ transplantation
Cy) | Sharing of needles

That's right!

Rationale
HIV is transmitted via sexual contact, organ transplantation, and the sharing of needles. HIV can only be
transmitted through drug use if the use involves infected needles. HIV is not transmitted through kissing. The

virus is unable to penetrate unbroken skin and is not spread via contact with saliva.

p. 445
Question 64

When providing education to a client with HIV in clinical category B, which common
symptom should be discussed? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

Cy) | Unusual cough

Wasting syndrome

| Diarrhea

Unusual bruising

| Fatigue

That's right!

Rationale

Some of the common symptoms that should be discussed with a client who has HIV in clinical category B
include a new or unusual cough, diarrhea, unusual bruising, and fatigue. Weight loss will occur, but wasting
syndrome is a marked change in body weight that occurs in category C, not B, infection.

p. 446
Question 65

The nurse assessing the HIV-infected client’s nutritional status uses the basic ABCDs
(anthropometry, biochemic tests, clinical observations, and dietary evaluations). Which
additional point would the nurse include in the assessment? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) mw] Environmental

rv) m| Family support
rv) mw) Financial

Enteral nutrition

Fluids and electrolytes

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse assessing the HIV-infected client’s nutritional status using the basic ABCDs will also include the
additional points "E" for environmental and "F" for financial to the assessment. Family support is included
under "Environmental." Enteral nutrition is not a specific element of the acronym ABCDEF assessment of the
HIV-infected client, nor are fluids and electrolytes.

p. 449
Question 66

In conjunction with the adverse effects of HIV infection, which contributes to the common

symptoms of diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption?

O Anorexia

rv) © Drug-—diet interactions

O Food insecurity
O Hypermetabolism

That's right!

Rationale

Diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption result from drug—diet interactions in conjunction with the progressive
effects of HIV infection. Anorexia is a result of inadequate food intake. Food insecurity can contribute to
malnutrition, but neither anorexia nor food insecurity is directly responsible for diarrhea or nutrient

malabsorption. Hypermetabolism does not cause diarrhea or nutrient malabsorption, though it is associated
with weight loss.

p. 448
Question 67

Which is a cause of body wasting in a client with HIV? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Malabsorption of nutrients

Lipoatrophy

Cachexia

m| Inadequate food intake

| Disordered metabolism

That's right!

Rationale

Body wasting in clients with HIV may result from malabsorption of nutrients, inadequate food intake, and/or
disordered metabolism. Lipoatrophy is a reduction of body fat, specifically in the limbs and face. Cachexia is
the wasting of the body itself, not a cause of it.

p. 448
Question 68

Which is a basic nutrition objective or goal of medical nutrition therapy during cancer

treatment? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Promoting weight loss for obese clients

Maintaining tight caloric restrictions

rv) | Maintaining lean body mass

Preventing satiety

| Identifying and managing treatment-related side effects

| Preventing unintentional weight gain

That's right!

Rationale

The basic nutrition objectives or goals of medical nutrition therapy include maintaining lean body mass,
identifying and managing side effects of treatment, and preventing unintentional weight gain. Promoting
weight loss for obese clients is not recommended during medical nutrition therapy because increased
metabolic demands can result in catabolism. Maintaining tight caloric restrictions is not a goal because a
balanced, nutritious diet is important to promote healing and prevent catabolism. Preventing satiety is not a

goal. Satiety describes a feeling of satisfaction or fullness following food intake.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 440
Question 69

Which dietary modification would be used for a patient experiencing gastrointestinal side

effects of chemotherapy? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Avoid unintentional weight gain.

rv) | Avoid hot, sweet, fatty, or spicy foods.

rv) m| Consume small and frequent feedings.

rv) m| Eat soft or liquid room temperature foods.

Gradually increase fiber and fluid intake.

Add spices, herbs, seasonings, and sauces.

That's right!

Rationale

Gastrointestinal problems, like nausea and vomiting, associated with chemotherapy can be relieved by
avoiding hot, sweet, fatty, or spicy foods. Consuming small and frequent feedings also can ease discomfort.
Soft or liquid cold or room temperature foods may relieve symptoms. A patient undergoing chemotherapy
treatment would not want to avoid gaining weight; rather, they will likely experience weight loss and should
try to maintain their weight. Adding fiber and fluids to the diet can help with constipation, but this is not a
problem typically associated with chemotherapy. Although adding spices, herbs, seasonings, and sauces can
help with taste and smell alterations, it is contraindicated if patients have nausea and vomiting.

Test-Taking Tip: Read every word of each question and option before responding to the item. Glossing over
the questions just to get through the examination quickly can cause you to misread or misinterpret the real
intent of the question.

p. 439
Question 70

Which consequence occurs with cancer-related cachexia? Select all that apply.One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

Loss of function

ncreased morbidity

ncreased mortality

Poor quality of life

ncreased medical costs

So close!

Rationale

Cachexia is debilitating for patients. It can lead to overall loss of function because of nutritional deficiencies
and weight loss. Morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with cachexia because of additional hospital
admissions and increased length of stay. Poor quality of life occurs with cancer-related cachexia because the

patient loses muscle mass and loss of function. Additional hospital admissions and treatments increase the
medical costs for the patient and contribute to poor quality of life.

p. 438
Question 71

Which of the following measures best addresses cancer-related cachexia?

©) Provide aggressive medical nutrition therapy
© Use medication therapy to alleviate symptoms

O Follow the standard effective treatment for cachexia

Cy) © Alleviate the cancer and the metabolic abnormalities associated with it

That's right!

Rationale

The best way to treat cancer-related cachexia is to alleviate the cancer and the metabolic abnormalities

associated with it. Aggressive medical nutrition therapy and medication therapy should be practiced by the

health care team because it is not always possible to alleviate the cancer, which is the best way to treat cancer-
related cachexia. There is no standard effective treatment for cachexia.

p. 438
Question 72

Which factor causes wasting in patients in the advanced stages of HIV? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Anorexia
rv) mw) Diarrhea
Lipodystrophy

rv) m| Muscle disuse

Abnormal metabolism

That's right!

Rationale

Anorexia, or loss of appetite, leading to inadequate food intake contributes to weight loss in HIV/AIDS
patients. Diarrhea is a common side effect of drug-diet interactions and HIV infection. It can lead to the
malabsorption of nutrients contributing to wasting. Lack of participation in physical activity (disuse) coupled
with systemic inflammation exacerbates muscle wasting. Abnormal metabolism alone will not cause wasting
because the elevated resting energy expenditure and decrease in physical activity offset each other. Although it
contributes to abnormal body composition of AIDS patients, the causative factor for lipodystrophy is
antiretroviral therapy; lipodystrophy is not a process that causes the characteristic body wasting seen in HIV.

p. 448
Question 73

Which nutrition-related problem is observed in patients undergoing radiation therapy?

Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) mw] Anorexia and nausea

Reduced blood cell count and anemia

Interference with normal hair growth

| Sensitivity to food texture and temperature

| Ulcers, inflammation, obstructions, and fistulas

That's right!

Rationale

Anorexia and nausea can occur when radiation treatment disturbs oral mucosa and salivary secretions,
affecting taste sensations. Radiation therapy, when used to treat cancer of the head, neck, or esophagus, also
affects taste sensations and sensitivity to food texture and temperature. Ulcers, inflammation, obstructions,
and fistulas can occur when radiation therapy is administered to the abdominal area, causing a loss of
intestinal villi and tissue breakdown. Chemotherapy, not radiation therapy, can cause disturbances of the bone
marrow, which can result in a reduced blood cell count and anemia; however, these are not nutrition-related
problems. Interference with normal hair growth and general hair loss are side effects of chemotherapy but are
not nutrition-related problems.

p. 437
Question 74

Place the stages of the disease progression of HIV/AIDS in the correct order.

Cy) 1. HIV infection occurs.

2. Development of antibodies occurs.

3. Viral incubation takes over the CD4 cells.

Infectious illnesses begin to invade the body.

5. T-lymphocyte counts decline, and the criteria for a diagnosis of
AIDS is met.

>

That's right!

Rationale

After the initial exposure and infection of HIV, antibodies to the viral infection begin to develop. Then, there is
a long period of viral incubation in which the infected person typically feels well. During this time the virus

takes over CD4 cells and gains power. After the asymptomatic HIV-positive stage, associated infectious

illnesses mark the terminal stage of HIV infection, known as AIDS.

pp. 446-447
Question 75

Place the steps of a nutritional assessment for a patient with HIV in the correct order.

tx} 1. Patient is referred to a nutrition professional.

tx} 2. Use of a screening tool to establish nutritional status.

3. Typical ABCD nutritional evaluations are performed.

rv] 4. Environmental, behavioral, and psychologic factors are considered.

5. Financial status is evaluated.

So close!

Question 76

Which nutrition recommendation reduces the risk for breast cancer? Select all that

apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) m| Consume a plant-based diet.

m| Maintain regular physical activity.

Follow a diet rich in whole grains and fiber.

rv) m| Avoid red meat, processed meat, and saturated fat.

| Avoid dietary supplements as the main source of nutrients.

That's right!

Rationale

Consuming a plant-based diet has a strong protective association against breast cancer. Getting regular
physical activity is beneficial for reducing the risk for breast cancer because it helps reduce excess body fat. A
diet that avoids red meat, processed meat, and saturated fat is associated with protection from breast cancer.
Dietary supplements should not be used as main source of nutrients to reduce the risk for breast cancer. A
diet that is rich in whole grains and fiber can reduce the risk for colorectal cancer, but it is not beneficial in

reducing the risk for breast cancer.

eating may help with nausea and vomiting but has no effect on anorexia.

p. 439
Question 78

Which nutrition intervention is included in the plan of care for patients with cancer? Select

all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Always consider enteral or parenteral nutrition support.

Prevent nutrient deficiencies and unintentional weight loss.

Maintain tolerance to treatment, immune function, and quality of life.

Maintain or improve lean body mass, strength, energy, and functional ability.

Identify and manage nutrition-related side effects of cancer and treatment modalities.

That's right!

Rationale

Preventing nutrient deficiencies and unintentional weight loss is an important intervention when developing a
plan of care for patients with cancer and can be controlled by continually updating according to the patient
status. It is important for the cancer patient to maintain tolerance to treatment, immune function, and quality
of life by appropriate methods offered by the health care professional. Patients with cancer should maintain or
improve lean body mass, strength, energy, and functional ability; this need should be carefully considered
when developing a plan of care. Side effects from cancer and its treatment should be carefully monitored and
controlled by making changes to the nutrition intervention plan. Enteral or parenteral nutrition support
should be considered if the patient is unable to tolerate normal intake of food, but it should only be used if

the nutrition status continues to decline.

p. 440
Question 79

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system for HIV,

which client is considered to have AIDS?

x) © A client in category B with any stage 2 CD4+ T-lymphocyte count

O A client in category A with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 500 cells/yiL or more
rv) O A client in category C with any stage 3 CD4+ T-lymphocyte count

O A client in category B with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 200-499 cells/yL

So close!

Rationale

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system for HIV, a client is
considered to have AIDS if they are in clinical category C with any stage 3 CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. A client
in clinical category B is considered to have AIDS only if the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is in stage 3 (more than
200 cells/uL). A client in category A with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 500 cells/piL or more is not considered
to have AIDS. The CD4+ T lymphocyte count is a stage 1 count. The client in category B with a CD4+ T
lymphocyte count of 200-499 cells/yL is not considered to have AIDS.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 447
Question 80

A client’s initial HIV test is indeterminate but 6 months later comes back positive. Using the

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system for HIV, in which stage of
HIV is this client?

That's right!

Rationale
The client is in stage 0 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s classification system.
Stage 0 is defined as an “early HIV infection, inferred from a negative or indeterminate HIV test result within 6

months of a confirmed positive test." Clients are categorized as being in stages 1, 2, and 3 based on their
CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and symptomatic conditions.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 446
Question 81

Which is a current established goal for the medical management of HIV infection? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv) | Treating infection early

rv) | Preventing opportunistic illness

rv) m| Boosting the immune system

Using prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection

Providing high-dose radiation therapy for tumors

That's right!

Rationale

Current goals for the medical management of HIV infection include recognizing and treating infection early,
preventing opportunistic illness, and boosting the immune system. Prophylactic antibiotics are not used to
prevent infection, and high-dose radiation therapy is not used for clients with HIV. Low-dose radiation or

anticancer drugs may be used to slow the spread of tumors if they occur during the disease process.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or client. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 447
Question 82

Which class of HIV antiretroviral therapy is associated with an increased risk for
lipoatrophy? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) | Protease inhibitors

Integrase inhibitors

rv) m| Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors

Fusion inhibitors

C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists

That's right!

Rationale

Lipoatrophy is a side effect of treatment with protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase

inhibitors. Integrase inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, and CCR5 antagonists are associated with other side effects,
not lipoatrophy.

p. 449
Question 83

Which side effect is reported by patients with HIV who take antiretroviral medications?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
rv) m| Nausea

| Altered taste

Increased appetite

mw) Diarrhea

oO
rv) m| Hyperglycemia
oO

That's right!

Rationale

Antiretroviral medications have multiple side effects, including nausea, altered taste, hyperglycemia, and
diarrhea. Increased appetite is not a known side effect of using antiretroviral medications.

p. 447
Question 84

Which risk is associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by

patients with cancer? Select all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

rv] m| CAM has not been proven to be effective in cancer.
rv] m| Some restrictive diets cause nutrient deficiencies.
rv] | Patients often do not disclose information about the use of CAM.
rv] | Results of clinical experimentation have not proven that CAM is safe.
rv] m| Dietary supplements can have dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs.
I °
That's right!
Rationale

Many CAM practices have undergone clinical experimentation and failed to produce any positive or cancer-
protective results. Experts discourage the use of macrobiotic diets for cancer prevention because of the
restrictive nature of the diet and the risk for multiple nutrient deficiencies. Patients often feel uncomfortable
discussing their CAM practices with their health care provider, which could result in serious consequences.
Clinical experimentation has determined that some CAM practices are not safe in patients with cancer. Dietary
supplements can have dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs and reduce the effectiveness of

chemotherapy.

Test-Taking Tip: Monitor questions that you answer with an educated guess or changed your answer from the
first option you selected. This will help you to analyze your ability to think critically. Usually your first answer is

correct and should not be changed without reason.

p. 444
Question 85

Which is the best dietary recommendation for a client diagnosed with HIV infection?
© High-calorie diet
© High-protein diet

@ ©@ Standard dietary recommendations
© High-carbohydrate diet

That's right!

Rationale

There are no specific dietary recommendations for a client diagnosed with HIV infection other than meeting
their general dietary needs. Dietary changes such as high-calorie, high-protein, or high-carbohydrate diets
aim to reduce or eliminate malnutrition (if the risk is present) and to correct any other nutritional problems

identified in the nutritional assessment.

p. 450
Question 86

Which potential change in a client’s body fat can occur during therapy with nucleoside

reverse transcriptase inhibitors?
O Lipodystrophy
O Lipohypertrophy

rv) © Lipoatrophy

O Hyperlipidemia

That's right!

Rationale

A client treated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is at risk for lipoatrophy, which is a reduction
in body fat. Lipodystrophy is abnormal fat redistribution associated with metabolic abnormalities and an
increased risk for chronic conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance.
Lipohypertrophy occurs with the use of protease inhibitors and causes an increase in the fat mass around the

abdomen and the back of the neck. Hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by abnormally elevated levels
of fats or lipids in the blood.

Question 1

Which food is the most abundant dietary source of saturated fats?

That's right!

Rationale
Most saturated fats are of animal origin, coming from foods like red meat and eggs. Olives, fish, and legumes

are examples of food sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 28
Question 2

Which important dietary factor contributes to a higher risk for chronic disease? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Low intake of omega-3 fats
[|_| Consuming poultry and fish
@ [B) High intake of processed meat
© [BB] Adding coconut and palm oils to the diet

@ |B] Consuming dairy fats and egg yolks

So close!

Rationale

Two important dietary factors that are associated with a higher risk of chronic disease are low intake of
omega-3 fats from seafood, which are important components of the diet, and high intake of processed meat.
Dairy fats and egg yolks contain saturated fats and cholesterol, which can contribute to a higher risk for
chronic disease. Consuming lean poultry and fish is important to reduce the risk of chronic disease. Coconut
and palm oils are not considered to be contribute to a higher risk for chronic disease, although they do
contain saturated fats derived from plants.

p. 33
Question 3

Which element is a basic component of a lipid? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [B) Oxygen

@ |B) Carbon

@ [B) Hydrogen
[| Calcium

[|_| Phosphate

[| Sodium

That's right!

Rationale

All lipids are composed of the same basic chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Calcium,
phosphate, and sodium are not the basic components of lipids.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 28
Question 4

A tablespoon of which food has the greatest amount of trans fat?

O Butter

O Cream cheese

ivy) © Margarine

That's right!

Rationale
One tablespoon of margarine has 3 g of trans fat, which is more than that found in butter (0.5 g), cream

cheese (0.1 g), and mayonnaise (0 g).

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

pp. 33-34
Question 5

Which products contain trans fats and should be limited in the diet?

© Fats that are liquid at room temperature

@ © Partially hydrogenated oils

© Fatty acids
O Animal fats

That's right!

Rationale

Partially hydrogenated oils are trans fats with double-bonded structures and are high in hydrogenated
unsaturated fats; these should be limited in the diet. Fats that are liquid at room temperature are high in
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils and can be consumed as part of a healthy diet. Fatty acids are the
basic elements of fats and are consumed with all fats. Animal fats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol
and should be limited in the diet.

p. 30
Question 6

Which type of fat remains in meat after the excess fat has been trimmed off?

O Visible
O Obvious
O Reduced

ivy) © Invisible

That's right!

Rationale

Invisible fat is the fat in the meat that remains after the excess fat has been removed. The visible fats and
obvious fats can be trimmed off. Reduced fat is the term to apply to foods containing less fat than usual.

p. 33
Question 7

Which substance combines with fatty acids to become a triglyceride?

@ @ Glycerol
© Bile salts

© Monoglycerides
© Cholesterol

That's right!

Rationale

Glycerol and fatty acids combine to form triglycerides after passing through the villi. Bile salts move
cholesterol, monoglycerides, and fatty acids from the lumen to the villi for absorption. Monoglycerides and

cholesterol are transported by bile salts from the lumen to the villi.

p. 28
Question 8

Which part of the digestive system begins the process of digesting fats?
©) Stomach

iv) © Mouth
O Liver

O Small intestine

That's right!

Rationale

The mouth begins the mechanical digestion of fats. The stomach provides virtually no chemical digestion of
fats. The liver does not digest fats. Although the small intestine is involved in the digestion of fats, this is not

where the process of digesting fats begins.

p. 34
Question 9

Production of which substance is initiated when fat enters the duodenum?

© Monoglycerides
© Fatty acids

@ © Cholecystokinin
© Bile salts

That's right!

Rationale
Cholecystokinin is released from the duodenum walls when fat enters the duodenum. Triglycerides are broken
down into monoglycerides and fatty acids by cholecystokinin. Bile salts move cholesterol, monoglycerides,

and fatty acids from the lumen to the villi for absorption.

p. 35
Question 10

Which organ stores bile?

ivy) © Gallbladder

O Small intestine

That's right!

Rationale

The gallbladder stores bile, whereas the liver produces it. The pancreas secretes glucagon and insulin, as well
as amylase and lipase. The small intestine receives bile and pancreatic enzymes to aid in the digestion and
absorption of fats.

p. 35
Question 11

Which organ produces bile?
©) Stomach

O Pancreas
ivy) © Liver

O Gallbladder

That's right!

Rationale
The liver produces bile. The stomach secretes gastric juice. The pancreas produces lipase and amylase. The

gallbladder stores bile.

p. 35
Question 12

Which substance does the pancreas produce?
© Bile
© Lecithinase
© Cholecystokinin

ivy) © Lipase

That's right!

Rationale

The pancreas produces lipase. Bile is produced in the liver. The small intestine secretes an enzyme in the
intestinal juice called lecithinase, which breaks down lecithin for absorption. Cholecystokinin is released from

the duodenum walls when fat enters the duodenum.

p. 35
Question 13

Which is true regarding the storage of fat after digestion?
© The body is unable to store fat.

O Fat is stored in the nuclei of cells.
@ @ Fat is stored in adipose tissue.

O Fat is stored in muscle.

That's right!

Rationale

Fat is stored in the body in adipose tissue. Fat is not stored in the nuclei of cells or in muscles.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 28
Question 14

Which substance is secreted by the Ebner glands?

@ ©@ Lingual lipase

©) Pancreatic lipase

O Cholesterol esterase

O Bile salts

That's right!

Rationale
Lingual lipase is secreted by the Ebner glands. Pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase are secreted by the

pancreas. Bile salts are produced in the liver.

p. 34
Question 15

Which lipoproteins are formed after lipids are absorbed from food?
©) Low-density lipoproteins
© High-density lipoproteins
© Very low-density lipoproteins

@ ©@ Chylomicrons

That's right!

Rationale
Chylomicrons are the first lipoproteins formed after the absorption of lipids from food. Low-density and very

low-density lipoproteins carry fat and cholesterol to the cells. High-density lipoproteins carry cholesterol from

the tissues to the liver.

p. 37
Question 16

Where is dietary fat absorbed in the digestive system?
©) Stomach

iv) © Small intestine

O Large intestine
© Gallbladder

That's right!

Rationale
Dietary fat is absorbed in the small intestine. The stomach begins the mechanical digestion of fat. The large
intestine is a vehicle to remove undigested fat into the feces. The gallbladder releases bile into the small

intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of fat.

p. 35
Question 17

Which is the package that transports fat from the lumen to the villi?
© Chylomicrons

iv) © Micelles
O Bile salts

© Monoglycerides

That's right!

Rationale

Within the small intestine, bile salts surround the monoglycerides and fatty acids to form micelles, which
transport the lipids across the membrane. Chylomicrons are the first lipoproteins formed after the absorption
of lipids from food. Bile salts and monoglycerides help form micelles.

p. 37
Question 18

Which food would be recommended for a vegan patient who has been advised by the
doctor to eat a heart-healthy diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [mB] Nuts
© [my Fish
@ |B] Olives
[| Palm oil
@ [| Soybean oil
© [| Low-fat milk

So close!

Rationale

Nuts, olives, and soybean oil are foods do not contain cholesterol and are recommended for a heart-healthy
diet. Fish are high in unsaturated fats, which are appropriate for a heart-healthy diet, but vegans do not eat
fish. Palm oil is high in saturated fat and is not recommended for a heart-healthy diet. Low-fat milk may be

low in fat, but it is from an animal source, and vegans do not consume animal-based products.

pp. 33-34
Question 19

Which substance transports lipids into the bloodstream?
iv) © Lipoproteins
© Bile salts

© Enteric lipase

© Glycerol

That's right!

Rationale

Lipoproteins transport lipids into the bloodstream via the lymphatic system. Bile salts emulsify fat. Enteric
lipase within the intestinal wall completes the digestion of the remaining diglycerides and monoglycerides,
releasing fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol combines with fatty acid chains to form triglycerides.

p.31
Question 20

Which substance is an emulsifier?

iv) © Bile salts

© Enteric lipase
© Triglycerides

© Glycerol

That's right!

Rationale
Bile salts act as an emulsifier. Enteric lipase within the intestinal wall completes digestion of diglycerides and

monoglycerides, releasing fatty acids and glycerol. Triglycerides facilitate lipid absorption and transport via the
lymphatic system. Glycerol combines with fatty acid chains to form triglycerides.

p. 35
Question 21

Which component helps split large fat globules into smaller particles?
O Lipase
O Micelle

@ @ Emulsifier

O Chylomicron

That's right!

Rationale

Emulsifiers break down large fat globules into smaller particles. A lipase is a type of enzyme that breaks
triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. A micelle is a bile and fat complex that transports fat into the wall of
the small intestine. A chylomicron is a lipoprotein that transports food fats into the lymph and then into the
general circulation.

p. 37
Question 22

Which substance surrounds monoglycerides and fatty acids in the lumen of the intestine,
allowing them to travel to the villi for absorption?

tx} © Micelles
iv) O Bile salts
© Glycerol

© Triglycerides

So close!

Rationale

Bile salts surround monoglycerides and fatty acids in the lumen of the intestine, allowing them to travel to the
villi for absorption. Micelles are formed when bile salts surround the monoglycerides and fatty acids. Glycerol
and fatty acids combine after passing through the villi to make triglycerides. Triglycerides are a combination of
fatty acids and glycerol once transported to the villi for absorption.

p. 35
Question 23

What is true regarding the absorption of lipids?
@ © Lipid absorption occurs in the small intestine.

© The body is unable to absorb lipids.
© Lipids are transported via hemoglobin.

© Lipids are small, easily absorbed molecules.

That's right!

Rationale
Absorption of lipids occurs in the small intestine. Lipids are absorbed in the body. Lipids are transported via
the lymph system, not hemoglobin, into the circulation. Lipids are larger molecules and require significant

breakdown before transport.

p. 35
Question 24

Which product would the nurse advise patients to avoid, as it is high in saturated fat? Select

all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[| Canola oil
[| Olive oil

@ |B) Butter

@ |B] T-bone steak
[| Salmon

[| Canned tuna

That's right!

Rationale
Butter and fatty beef, like T-bone steak, are animal fats high in saturated fats. Canola and olive oils are not

animal fats. They contain unsaturated fats and are recommended to lower the risk of heart disease. Salmon

and canned tuna contain high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which are recommended to lower heart

disease; fish is considered a lean protein.

pp. 33-34
Question 25

Which food is high in fat and recommended in small portions only? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

|_| Eggs
@ |B) Cheese
© [BB] Frozen yogurt
@ [| Nuts
@ [B] Mayonnaise
[| Fruit

So close!

Rationale

Cheese has 14 to 18 g of fat per ounce, nuts have 22 g of fat per ounce, and mayonnaise has 11 g of fat per
tablespoon, making these the fattiest foods of the answer choices. One egg has 5 g of fat, frozen yogurt has 2
g of fat per 1/2 c, and fruit has only a trace amount of fat, making these low-fat options.

pp. 33-34
Question 26

Which plant oil is high in saturated fat?
© Cottonseed oil

O Olive oil

O Canola oil

ivy) © Coconut oil

That's right!

Rationale

Coconut oil is high in saturated fat. Cottonseed, olive, and canola oils are high in monounsaturated and

polyunsaturated fats and low in saturated fats.

p. 29
Question 27

In what way are fatty acids classified? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may

be correct.

@ [B] Essentiality

iv) [ml] Degree of saturation
@ [BB] Length of the chain

|_| Appearance of the chains, with a methyl group in the middle

|_| Appearance of the chains, with an acid carboxyl group in the middle

That's right!

Rationale
Fatty acids can be classified according to their essentiality, degree of saturation, and chain length. The
appearance of fatty acid chains is marked by a methyl group on the omega end and a carboxylic acid group on

the alpha end.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 28
Question 28

Which food option has the least amount of fat per serving?

© Danish pastry
O Slice of cheese

O Whole milk

ivy) © Skim milk

That's right!

Rationale

Skim milk contains a trace amount of fat; a Danish pastry, a slice of cheese, and whole milk contain more fat.

Test-Taking Tip: If you can eliminate any responses as incorrect based on your knowledge, you will not be
guessing randomly but will be exercising "informed guessing.’

p. 34
Question 29

Which term is the chemical group name for fats?
© © Lipids
@ © Glycerides

© Fatty acids

© Triglycerides

So close!

Rationale

Glycerides is the chemical group name for fats. The chemical group name for organic substances of a fatty
nature is lipids. Fatty acids are the major structural component of fats. Triglycerides is the chemical name for
fats in the body and in food.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal
the correct answer.

p. 28
Question 30

Which is a role of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid in the body? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.
@ [B) Maintain skin integrity
iv) [ml] Support immune function
[_] Form bile acids
@ [B) Aggregate blood platelets

[| Serve as a precursor to steroid hormones

That's right!

Rationale
Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids maintain skin integrity by strengthening cell membranes, support immune
function, and aggregate blood platelets. Cholesterol is necessary for the formation of bile acids and is a

precursor to steroid hormones.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 30
Question 31

For which purpose are lipids stored in the body as adipose tissue? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |] Regulates body temperature
|_| Provide energy

iv) [ml] Store energy

@ [B] Support vital organs

|_| Supply essential acids

That's right!

Rationale

Lipids stored as adipose tissue promote thermal insulation for regulating body temperature, store energy for
later use, and serve as protection and support for vital organs. Dietary lipids provide energy and supply

essential fatty acids.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 32
Question 32

Which types of fat raise blood levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol?

iv) © Saturated and trans fats

© Trans and polyunsaturated fats
O Monounsaturated and saturated fats

© Saturated and polyunsaturated fats

That's right!

Rationale

Saturated and trans fats are known to raise the levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Polyunsaturated
fats lower blood levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Monounsaturated fats lower blood levels of
total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol when substituted for saturated fat. Although saturated fats raise total and

LDL cholesterol levels, polyunsaturated fats do not.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the incorrect choices,
recall often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds

Question 33

Place the organs of the gastrointestinal system in the correct sequence for the digestion of
fat.

1. Mouth

2. Esophagus

3. Stomach

Liver

5. Pancreas

6. Small and large intestines

>

That's right!

Rationale

Digestion begins when food enters the oral cavity. Mastication breaks down the food into small particles, and
saliva amylase begins to digest carbohydrates. The chewed food forms a ball called a bolus, which passes
through the esophagus to the stomach via peristalsis. Once in the stomach, digestive juices kill bacteria, and
enzymes break down proteins. The liver secretes bile to break down fats. Next, the pancreas is stimulated,
resulting in the secretion of more digestive enzymes. Food mixed with bile from the liver and enzymes from

resulting in the secretion of more digestive enzymes. Food mixed with bile from the liver and enzymes from
the pancreas enter the small intestine for absorption. The final phase of digestion occurs as indigestible food

and water are processed, stored, and dispersed by the large intestine.

Test-Taking Tip: In this question type, you are asked to prioritize (put in order) the options presented. For
example, you might be asked the steps of performing an action or demonstrating a skill, such as those

involved in medication administration.

p. 36
Question 34

How many kilocalories are yielded when the body burns 1 g of fat?

That's right!

Rationale
Fats, also known as lipids, yield 9 kcal/g when oxidized by the body, whereas carbohydrates and protein yield

only 4 kcal/g.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 32
Question 35

Which statement is true about essential fatty acids?

© They are complexes of fat with protein that carry lipids through the bloodstream.

@ @ They are fatty acids that must be obtained by dietary sources because the body cannot synthesize
them.

© Essential fatty acids is the chemical name for fats with a structure of three fatty acids attached to a
glycerol base.

© They are fats formed from glycerol by the replacement of one to three hydroxyl (OH) groups with a
fatty acid.

That's right!

Rationale

Essential fatty acids must be present in the diet because the body cannot synthesize them. Lipoproteins are
complexes of fat with protein that carry lipids through the bloodstream. Triglyceride is the chemical name for
fats with a structure of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol base. Glycerides are fats formed from glycerol by
the replacement of one to three hydroxyl groups with a fatty acid.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal

the correct answer.

Question 36

Which is a function of food lipids? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may

be correct.
@ |B] Add to food palatability

@ [BR] Promote feeling full

@ [BB] Supply essential fatty acids
© [] Form cell membranes

tx} [ml] Transmit nerve impulses

So close!

Rationale

The functions of food lipids are to add to the palatability of food, promote satiety (or feeling full), and supply
essential fatty acids. The formation of cell membranes and transmission of nerve impulses are functions of

lipids in the body, such as adipose tissue, not food lipids.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 32
Question 37

Which is the best description of what happens to bile after it emulsifies fat?

© Itis excreted in feces with undigested fats.
O It becomes cholesterol and is stored in the muscle.

O It becomes bilirubin and is excreted in urine.

ivy) © It is reabsorbed and returned to the liver for reuse.

That's right!

Rationale

Bile is reabsorbed and returned to the liver for reuse after it emulsifies fat. Bile is not excreted in feces with
undigested fats. Bile does not become cholesterol, and cholesterol is stored in adipose tissue, not muscle. Bile
does not become bilirubin for excretion in the urine.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 35
Question 38

Which substance is responsible for separating fatty acids from triglycerides?

@ @ Pancreatic lipase

O Cholesterol esterase

O Lecithinase

O Bile salts

That's right!

Rationale

Pancreatic lipase breaks off one fatty acid at a time from the glycerol base of triglycerides. The enzyme
cholesterol esterase acts on cholesterol esters. The small intestine secretes an enzyme in the intestinal juice
called lecithinase, which breaks down lecithin for absorption. Bile salts move cholesterol, monoglycerides, and

fatty acids from the lumen to the villi for absorption.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 35
Question 39

How many carbon atoms are attached to a medium-chain fatty acid?

That's right!

Rationale

Medium-chain fatty acids have 6 to 10 carbon atoms. Short-chain fatty acids have 2 to 4 carbons. Carbon
atoms in the range of 5 to 8 do not classify a particular type of fatty acid. Long-chain fatty acids have more
than 12 carbon atoms attached to the chain.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words, (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks, and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 28
Question 40

Which essential fatty acid must be obtained from food because the body cannot make

sufficient amounts? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Linoleic
[| Palmitic

[| Arachidonic

@ [B) Alpha-linolenic

|_| Omega-3 fatty

That's right!

Rationale

Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids are the essential acids that must be obtained from food because the body
cannot synthesize them. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid found in food sources. Arachidonic acid is
converted in the body from dietary linoleic acid. Omega-3 fatty acid is a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid
found in food. Alpha-linolenic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Rely on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this,
read the question, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, look at all of
the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

Question 41

In which part of the digestive tract does fat digestion largely occur?
©) Stomach

O Pancreas
ivy) © Small intestine

O Large intestine

That's right!

Rationale

Fat digestion largely occurs in the small intestine, where the major enzymes necessary for chemical changes in
fat are present. Little, if any, chemical digestion of fat occurs in the stomach. No digestion of food occurs in
the pancreas. Pancreatic juice that flows into the small intestine helps in the digestion of fat. Some fats are
partially digested in the large intestine; the rest pass through unchanged, exiting in feces.

p. 35
Question 42

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food-labeling regulations for
nutrition facts panel content, which information is mandatory relating to dietary fat in food
products? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[| Monounsaturated fat

@ |B Total fat
|_| Polyunsaturated fat
@ |B Saturated fat
@ [B) Trans fat
@ [By Cholesterol

That's right!

Rationale

According to the FDA food-labeling regulations for nutrition facts panel content, mandatory information
relating to dietary fat in food products includes total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. Disclosure of
information about monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat is voluntary, not mandatory.

p. 33
Question 43

Which feature describes the benefit of fats? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

@ |B] Serve as a fuel source for cellular energy
@ |B) Support and protect vital organs

|_| Aid in absorption of proteins
@ [B) Help in regulation of body temperature

@ |B] Form the fatty center of cell membranes, thereby creating the selectively permeable lipid bilayer

That's right!

Rationale

In addition to carbohydrates, fats serve as a fuel source for cellular energy. A web-like padding of fat tissue
supports and protects vital organs, and a layer of fat directly under the skin is important for the regulation of
body temperature. Fat forms the fatty center of cell membranes, thereby creating the selectively permeable
lipid bilayer. Embedded within this layer are proteins that allow for the transport of various nutrients in and
out of the cells. Fats do not aid in the absorption of proteins.

p. 32
Question 44

Which type of fat is present in foods such as margarine and considered unnecessary in

human nutrition?
O Linoleic acid

@ @ Trans-fatty acid

© Alpha-linolenic acid

O Lecithin

That's right!

Rationale

Commercially hydrogenated fats found in foods such as margarine are high in trans fats, which are
unnecessary in human nutrition and associated with many negative health consequences, such as
cardiovascular disease. Linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid are polyunsaturated fatty acids known to be
essential for complete human nutrition. Lecithin is a major phospholipid produced by the liver and is provided

by foods derived from animal products.

p. 30
Question 45

Which description is characteristic of unsaturated fats? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

@ [B] Not completely filled with all of the hydrogen that they can hold
@ (IB) Less heavy than saturated fats
iv) [ml] Liquid at room temperature

|_| More dense than saturated fats

iv) [ml] Found in safflower, sunflower, corn, and soybean oils

That's right!

Rationale

Fatty acids are saturated or unsaturated according to whether hydrogen ions fill each available spot on the
carbon backbone. A fatty acid that is not completely filled with all of the hydrogen that it can hold is an
unsaturated fat. Unsaturated fats are less dense and less heavy than saturated fats. This means they are liquid
at room temperature. Examples of foods that contain polyunsaturated fats are safflower, sunflower, corn, and
soybean oils. Unsaturated fats are not more dense than saturated fats.

p. 29
Question 46

Place the steps of fat absorption into the bloodstream in the correct order.

Bile salts surround the monoglycerides and fatty acids to form
micelles.

Fats, the products of lipid digestion, are absorbed into the

epithelial cells of the intestine.

Monoglycerides and fatty acids are reconstructed to form

triglycerides.

Chylomicrons package triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids,

and proteins.

Chylomicrons enter the lacteals, then the lymphatic circulatory

system, and eventually the bloodstream.

That's right!

Rationale

Within the small intestine, bile salts surround the monoglycerides and fatty acids to form micelles. The
micelles allow the products of lipid digestion to travel to the brush border membrane, where fats are absorbed
into the epithelial cells of the intestine. Monoglycerides and fatty acids that make it into the intestinal cells via
micelle transport reconstruct to form triglycerides. A carrier, chylomicron, packages the triglycerides, along
with cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins. Chylomicrons first enter the lacteals, then the lymphatic
circulatory system, and then eventually the bloodstream.

Question 47

For which function are eicosanoids responsible? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Blood clotting
© [m] Cellular signaling

[| Membrane fluidity

@ [BB] Blood pressure regulation

@ |B] Messengers for the central nervous system

iv) [ml] Inflammatory response

So close!

Rationale

Eicosanoids are responsible for multiple functions in the body, such as blood clotting and blood pressure
regulation. Eicosanoids also serve as messengers for the central nervous system. The inflammatory response
in the body is controlled by eicosanoids. Cellular signaling is controlled by sterols, not eicosanoids. Membrane
fluidity is a responsibility of sterols, not eicosanoids.

p.31
Question 48

In which way is the structure of unsaturated fatty acid molecules altered when vegetable oils
are hydrogenated? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B] The cis configuration of the molecule is changed to the trans form.

@ |B] Hydrogen atoms on either side of the double carbon bond move to opposite sides.

© [BB] The normal bend of the molecule remains the same but the hydrogen atoms relocate.
|_| Short-chain fatty acids are converted to long-chain fatty acids with more than 12 carbons.

|_|] Both hydrogen atoms around the double carbon bond are moved to the same side of the bond.

So close!

Rationale

Hydrogenation causes the configuration of the molecule to change from the cis form, meaning "same side,’ to
the trans form, meaning "opposite side.’ When vegetable oils are hydrogenated, the hydrogen atoms on either
side of the double carbon bond move to opposite sides from their original location on the same side of the
bond. When hydrogenation occurs, the normal bend of the molecule changes so that hydrogen atoms on
either side of the double carbon bond can move to opposite sides. The length of the fatty acid chains are not
altered when hydrogenation occurs. When vegetable oils are hydrogenated, the hydrogen atoms are moved to
opposite sides of the double carbon bond; they are not moved to the same side of the bond.

Question 49

Which cooking oil contains monounsaturated fat? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Olive oil
iv) [ml] Canola oil

[| Coconut oil

iv) [ml] Peanut oil

[| Sunflower oil

That's right!

Rationale

Monounsaturated fat can be found in vegetable oils like olive oil. Canola oil is vegetable oil that contains
monounsaturated fat. Peanut oil is a vegetable oil that contains monounsaturated fat. Coconut oil
predominantly contains saturated fats. Sunflower oil is a vegetable oil containing polyunsaturated fat.

p. 29
Question 50

Before trans-fatty acids were banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which
detrimental health effect had been associated with their consumption? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Increased low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels
@ |] Decreased high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels
|_| Decreased LDL cholesterol levels
[| Increased HDL cholesterol levels

@ [BB] Increased production of inflammatory cytokines

That's right!

Rationale

Observed effects of diets high in trans-fatty acids included an increase in LDL cholesterol, which is considered
the "bad" cholesterol. Decreased HDL cholesterol levels, the "good" cholesterol, were observed with diets high
in trans-fatty acids. Increased production of atherosclerotic inflammatory cytokines, leading to atherosclerosis
was also observed. Decreased LDL cholesterol levels are a desirable effect and were not associated with the
consumption of trans-fatty acids. Increased HDL cholesterol levels are also a desirable effect and were not
associated with the consumption of trans-fatty acids.

p. 39
Question 51

Which is a food source of solid fats? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may

be correct.

@ [my] Milk

@ |B) Butter

@ [By] Chicken

@ [Bm] Pork

© |] Sunflower seeds

[| Safflower oil

So close!

Rationale
Milk, butter, chicken, and pork are all sources of solid fats. Sunflower seeds and safflower oil provide

polyunsaturated fats, not solid fats.

p. 28
Question 52

Which is the best choice for a low-fat meal?

© Egg salad

© Blueberry muffin
@ @ Chicken and rice

©) Ice cream

That's right!

Rationale
Chicken and rice is a low-fat meal. Egg salad contains additional fat from mayonnaise. Muffins and ice cream

are high in fat.

pp. 33-34
Question 53

A patient who is attempting a recipe using cholesterol-free substances would eliminate the

use of which oil?

O Corn oil

© Soybean oil

O Peanut oil
ivy) © Lard

That's right!

Rationale
Lard is made from animal fats, and its use should be limited in cooking to keep foods low in cholesterol. Only

animal fats contain cholesterol, so corn oil, soybean oil, and peanut oil are cholesterol-free choices.

p. 33
Question 54

The nursing student is educating a patient about the functions of fat in the body. Which
statement requires correction by the preceptor?

© "Excess caloric intake from any macronutrient source is converted into stored fat throughout the

body."

© "As long as adequate amounts of essential fatty acids are in the diet, the body is capable of making
other fats and cholesterol as needed."

© "The effects of satiety and improved flavor are partly caused by the slower rate of digestion of fats
compared with that of carbohydrates."

@ ©@ "Fat substitutes are not considered safe by the Food and Drug Administration because their risks and
benefits have not been clearly identified."

That's right!

Rationale

Fat substitutes currently on the market are considered safe by the Food and Drug Administration, but their
risks and benefits have not been clearly identified. Caloric intake from any macronutrient source is converted
into stored fat throughout the body. As long as adequate amounts of essential fatty acids are in the diet, the
body is capable of making other fats and cholesterol as needed. The effects of satiety and improved flavor are
partly caused by the slower rate of digestion of fats compared with carbohydrates.

p. 32
Question 55

Which description is accurate regarding a chylomicron?

© Combines with glycerol to form triglycerides
© Released from gallbladder to emulsify fat in the small intestine
@ © A lipoprotein formed in the intestine to transport fat to the liver via the lymphatic system

© A digestive enzyme that breaks down triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol

That's right!

Rationale

A chylomicron is a lipoprotein formed in the intestinal wall to transport fat to the liver via the lymphatic
system. Triglycerides are formed from longer chain fatty acids, not chylomicrons, and glycerol to form new
human triglycerides. Bile, not chylomicrons, is released from the gallbladder to emulsify fat. A lipase is a type
of enzyme that break down triglycerides to fatty acids and glycerol.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 37
Question 56

Which phospholipid has control over inflammatory response, blood clotting, and blood
pressure regulation and serves as a messenger for the central nervous system?

O Cholesterol
© Phytosterols

That's right!

Rationale

Eicosanoids are signaling hormones in the phospholipid classification that exert control over multiple
functions in the body, like inflammatory response, blood clotting, and blood pressure regulation, and serve as
a messenger for the central nervous system. Bile is not a phospholipid; it is a substance produced by the liver
and stored in the gallbladder for use when fat digestion is needed. Lecithin is a major phospholipid that
transports fats and cholesterol throughout the body; it does not control body functions. Cholesterol is a
member of the sterol classification and is a precursor for some hormones; it does not control body functions.
Phytosterols are plant-made sterols that are responsible for membrane fluidity and cellular signaling, not
controlling body functions.

p.31
Question 57

What is the lipid substance produced by the ©..: is a key building block of cell

membranes?

O Cholesterol

O Lipoproteins

That's right!

Rationale

Lecithin is a lipid substance produced by the liver and a key building block of cell membranes. Bile, also
produced by the liver, emulsifies fat. Cholesterol is a precursor for some hormones, along with serving other
important roles in human metabolism. Lipoproteins are the major vehicles for lipid transport in the
bloodstream.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Rely on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do this,
read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and, based
on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at all of
the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

answering each question.

p.31
Question 58

Which describes the role of lipoproteins?

© Provides membrane fluidity and cellular signaling

@ @ Combines with triglycerides, protein, phospholipids, cholesterol, and other fat-soluble substances,
allowing fat to travel throughout the bloodstream

© Signals hormones that exert control over multiple functions in the body and are messengers for the
central nervous system

© Replaces one fatty acid with a phosphate group and is derived from a triglyceride, which allows for cell
membrane fluidity

That's right!

Rationale

The role of lipoproteins is to combine with triglycerides, proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol, and other fat-
soluble substances, allowing fat to travel throughout the bloodstream. Sterols play a variety of important roles,
including membrane fluidity and cellular signaling. Eicosanoids signal hormones that exert control over
multiple functions in the body and are messengers for the central nervous system. Phospholipids are
triglyceride derivatives in which one fatty acid has been replaced with a phosphate group, which allows for cell

membrane fluidity.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p.31
Question 59

Which type of fatty acid is unnecessary in human nutrition and poses multiple negative

health consequences?

iv) © Trans

O Saturated
O Unsaturated

©) Polyunsaturated

That's right!

Rationale

Trans fatty acids are unnecessary in human nutrition, pose a great number of negative health consequences
related to cardiovascular disease, and should be avoided in the diet. Saturated describes the state of being
filled; the more filled, the denser the fat is at room temperature. Unsaturated fats are liquid at room
temperature and include the essential fatty acids, which need to be supplied by food for the body.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids are the fatty acids that have two or more unfilled spots on the chain.

Test-Taking Tip: Be aware that information from previously asked questions may help you respond to other

examination questions.

p. 30
Question 60

Which food is the most abundant source of polyunsaturated fats?

O Canola oil

O Hazelnuts
O Coconut oil

ivy) © Sunflower oil

That's right!

Rationale

Sunflower oil contains large amounts of polyunsaturated fats, which mean the fatty acids have two or more
unfilled spots on the chain. Canola oil and hazelnuts contain large amounts of monounsaturated fats, and
coconut oil is an example of a saturated fat.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,
read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 29
Question 61

Which food is the most abundant dietary source of saturated fats?

ivy) © Red meat

That's right!

Rationale
Most saturated fats are of animal origin, coming from foods like red meat and eggs. Olives, fish, and legumes

are examples of food sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful, because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,

pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 28
Question 62

Which important dietary factor contributes to a higher risk for chronic disease? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Low intake of omega-3 fats
[|_| Consuming poultry and fish
@ [B) High intake of processed meat

|_| Adding coconut and palm oils to the diet

@ |B] Consuming dairy fats and egg yolks

That's right!

Rationale

Two important dietary factors that are associated with a higher risk of chronic disease are low intake of
omega-3 fats from seafood, which are important components of the diet, and high intake of processed meat.
Dairy fats and egg yolks contain saturated fats and cholesterol, which can contribute to a higher risk for
chronic disease. Consuming lean poultry and fish is important to reduce the risk of chronic disease. Coconut
and palm oils are not considered to be contribute to a higher risk for chronic disease, although they do
contain saturated fats derived from plants.

Question 1

Which protein comes from an animal source?

That's right!

Rationale

Milk is an animal source of protein. Soy, tofu, and pine nuts are all plant sources of protein.

p. 45,p. 45
Question 2

A nurse is planning a high-protein meal for a lacto-vegetarian patient. What selection is
most appropriate for this patient?

iv) © Yogurt

© French toast
© Scrambled eggs
O Chicken noodle soup

That's right!

Rationale

Lacto-vegetarians will consume protein from dairy products like yogurt. French toast contains egg, which is
not consumed by lacto-vegetarians. Scrambled eggs are not consumed by lacto-vegetarians. Chicken is an
animal source of protein that is not consumed by lacto-vegetarians.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 46,p. 46
Question 3

A patient tells the nurse, "| am going to order the scrambled eggs, skim milk, and whole
wheat toast with peanut butter. No sausage, though. | do not eat meat." Which type of
vegetarian diet does this patient follow?

ivy) © Lacto-ovo

That's right!

Rationale

The patient follows a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, which allows dairy products and eggs but no meat. Ovo-
vegetarians do not consume dairy products. Lacto-vegetarians do not consume eggs. Vegans do not consume

dairy products or eggs.

p. 46,p. 46
Question 4

Which food contains the most protein in a cooked 3-oz serving?

@ ©@ Lean top round beef
O Fried tofu

O Boiled kidney beans
O Pan-fried chicken liver

That's right!

Rationale

A 3-oz portion of animal meat has the highest amount of protein. The top round beef will have approximately
25-30 g of protein. Organ meat is also high in protein, with approximately 20-25 g per 3-oz portion. Plant
based proteins like tofu and kidney beans have far less protein per serving, with the tofu containing
approximately 15 g and the beans having less than 5 g.

p. 55,p. 55
Question 5

What type of food is a complete protein and should be included while planning a patient’s
diet?

That's right!

Rationale
Fish is an animal food that is considered a complete protein. Gelatin is an animal protein but is incomplete.

Peanuts and legumes are plant sources of protein that are incomplete proteins.

p. 45,p. 45
Question 6

Which characteristic determines the classification of a protein?

O Caloric content

O Protein content

O Vitamin content
ivy) © Amino acid content

That's right!

Rationale
Classification of proteins is based on the amino acid content. Caloric, protein, and vitamin contents do not

determine the classification of proteins.

[p. 42, pp. 107-110],p. 42
Question 7

In which location does the initial breakdown of protein into amino acids begin?
O Liver

@ © Mouth

© @ Stomach

O Small intestine

So close!

Rationale

The initial breakdown of protein into amino acids begins in the mouth through the mechanical breakdown of
chewing. The liver deaminates amino acids that are a byproduct of the protein. The enzymatic breakdown and
chemical digestion of protein begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine.

Test-Taking Tip: Work with a study group to create and take practice tests. Think of the kinds of questions you
would ask if you were composing the test. Consider what would be a good question, what would be the right
answer, and what would be other answers that would appear right but would in fact be incorrect.

p. 49,p. 49
Question 8

Which type of protein must be available to meet the body’s metabolic needs? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [| Plasma
@ |B) Complete
|_| Catabolic
@ [| Hormone
@ [_| Tissue

So close!

Rationale

Plasma, complete, hormone, and tissue proteins must be available to meet the body’s metabolic needs.

Catabolism is a metabolic process, not a protein.

p. 44,p. 44
Question 9

What type of food is considered an animal source of protein? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.
@ [| Fees
@ |B) Beef
@ [By] Gelatin
[| Soy curd

iv) [ml] Cow’s milk

That's right!

Rationale
Animal sources of protein include eggs, beef, gelatin, and cow’s milk. Soy curd, or tofu, is a plant source of

protein.

p. 45,p. 45
Question 10

A nurse is helping a vegan patient select a dinner meal. The health care provider wants to
ensure that the patient has adequate protein to promote wound healing. What meal
selection will allow for the highest amount of indispensable protein?

© Banana and peanut butter

©) Whole-wheat pasta with cheese

© Mixed fruit cup and cow's milk
@ @ Whole-grain bread and lentil soup

That's right!

Rationale

Complementary food combinations are made by mixing families of foods, such as grains and lentils, to
balance the needed amino acids. The combination of banana and peanut butter will not provide more protein
than the bread and soup. Vegans do not consume cheese or cow’s milk.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking by looking for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 48,p. 48
Question 11

Which meal selection is appropriate for a vegan patient who needs adequate protein?

© Baby spinach salad and milk
@ @ Steamed broccoli and soy milk
© ‘Sliced pears and hard-boiled eggs

© Whole wheat pasta with meat sauce

That's right!

Rationale
Vegans follow a strict vegetarian diet and consume no animal foods. Their diet consists entirely of plant foods,
such as broccoli and soy, the latter of which is the only plant source of complete proteins. Vegans do not

consume regular cow’s milk, eggs, or any meat.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 46,p. 46
Question 12

Which role does protein play in the immune system?

©) Produces antigens
@ ©@ Builds lymphocytes
O Promotes passive immunity

O Provides nutrient transport

That's right!

Rationale

Protein is used to build special white blood cells such as lymphocytes. Protein helps produce antibodies, not
antigens; antibodies defend the body against antigens that cause disease and infections. Passive immunity
occurs as a result of the introduction of antibodies from another person. Protein aids in metabolic function

through nutrient transport, which occurs during digestion.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 45,p. 45
Question 13

Which complete protein is ideal for adding to a diet of grains and legumes? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
@ [| Fees
@ (my Fish
@ [B) Tofu
|] Lentils
@ |B) Tempeh

That's right!

Rationale

Eggs, fish, tofu, and tempeh are complete proteins that can be added to a diet of grains and legumes. Lentils

are a type of legume and are not considered a complete protein.

p. 45,p. 45
Question 14

Which is the final enzyme in the protein-splitting system, and where is it produced?

© Trypsin produced in the pancreas
© Chymotrypsin produced in the pancreas
@ © Dipeptidase produced in the small intestine

© © Aminopeptidase produced in the small intestine

So close!

Rationale

The final enzyme in the protein-splitting system is dipeptidase, which is produced in the wall of the small
intestine. Trypsin is secreted from the pancreas and works on proteins and large polypeptide fragments that
arrive from the stomach. Chymotrypsin is produced by the pancreas and continues the protein-splitting action
of trypsin. Aminopeptidase is produced in the wall of the small intestine and attacks the nitrogen-containing
end of the peptide chain and releases amino acids one at a time.

p.51
Question 15

When breaking down protein, which process does the body use to maintain nitrogen
balance?

O Anabolism
O Excretion
O Catabolism

ivy) © Deamination

That's right!

Rationale

When breaking down protein, the body maintains nitrogen balance through deamination. During
deamination, the nitrogen-containing part of the amino group is removed. Anabolism is a process by which
amino acids are resynthesized into tissue proteins. The majority of nitrogen is excreted in the form of urea,
but the nitrogen must go through a process in the liver to be converted to urea before being excreted. During
catabolism, proteins are broken down from a large substance into smaller building blocks.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember

Question 16

Which finding can a nurse expect in a 20-month-old child who receives adequate calories
but lacks bioavailable protein sources? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

@ |B) Edema
@ [By Fatty liver

@ |] Stunted growth

[|_| Emaciated appearance
@ |B] Weakened immune system

That's right!

Rationale
Edema, fatty liver, stunted growth, and a weakened immune system are expected findings in a 20-month-old
child who receives adequate calories but lacks bioavailable protein sources. An emaciated appearance occurs

with marasmus, which results from chronic deficiency of many nutrients, not just protein.

p. 53
Question 17

Which patient circumstance may require increased amounts of dietary protein? Select all

that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
|] Diabetes

@ |B] Surgical recovery
|_| Liver disease

@ [| Burn injuries

@ |B) Breastfeeding

That's right!

Rationale
Patients who are recovering from surgery, have burn injuries, or are breastfeeding may require an increased
amount of dietary protein. Dietary protein intake may be restricted based on the severity of diabetes and liver

disease.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

pp. 53-54
Question 18

What is the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein for an adult weighing 150 Ib?

Record your answer using one decimal place. @ rv) g/day

So close!

Rationale

To determine the patient’s weight in kilograms, the nurse divides 150 |b by 2.2 kg to get 68.2 kg. The nurse
knows an adult requires 0.8 g of protein for each kilogram of body weight and so multiplies 68.2 kg by 0.8 g
to determine the patient’s RDA of protein is 54.6 g/day.

p. 54
Question 19

Which type of amino acid is necessary for patients experiencing certain illnesses?
©) Dispensable

© Indispensable
© Conditionally dispensable
@ © Conditionally indispensable

That's right!

Rationale

Conditionally indispensable amino acids are necessary for patients experiencing certain illnesses. The six
conditionally indispensable amino acids are normally produced by the body, but in circumstances such as
illness, the body cannot make them in high enough quantities. Dispensable amino acids are synthesized by
the body and do not have to be consumed on a daily basis. Indispensable amino acids must be obtained by
diet because the body does not make adequate amounts to support the body’s needs. A conditionally
dispensable amino acid is not a class of amino acids.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 43
Question 20

Where are amino acids absorbed?
O Stomach

O Liver

O Large intestine

ivy) © Portal circulation

That's right!

Rationale

Amino acids are absorbed in portal circulation from the small intestine and transferred to the liver. Amino
acids are not absorbed in the stomach, where a large part of protein digestion occurs. Amino acids are
converted in the liver. Amino acids are not absorbed in the large intestine.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p.51
Question 21

Which element distinguishes protein from other nutrients?
© Hydrogen
© Carbon
O Oxygen

ivy) © Nitrogen

That's right!

Rationale
Nitrogen distinguishes protein from other nutrients. The amino acids that make up protein contain hydrogen,

carbon, and oxygen, but these are not unique to protein.

p.42
Question 22

Which factor determines the function of proteins?

O Access to amino acids

© Ingestion of amino acids

©) Denaturing of the protein
@ ©@ Structure of the protein

That's right!

Rationale

The function of a protein is determined by its structure. A cell must have access to amino acids in order to
build a protein. The ingestion of amino acids does not determine function of a protein; it contributes to the
overall health of the body. A protein that has been denatured has been physically changed and may not be able
to serve its function.

p.42
Question 23

Which is an advantage of consuming a diet of complementary proteins? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

iv) [| They contain less fat.
iv) [| Plant foods cost less.

[| There is minimal meal planning.
iv) [| They prevent some chronic diseases.

@ [BB] They are the equivalent to a complete protein diet.

So close!

Rationale

A diet of complementary proteins is lower in fat, less expensive than a diet containing animal-derived foods,
preventive of some chronic diseases, and equivalent to a complete protein diet. The types of foods required

may not always be easily accessible and therefore require more preparation and planning.

p. 48
Question 24

Based on protein intake, which is an expected finding a nurse may observe in a patient
during a period of starvation?

© Zero nitrogen balance
@ @ Negative nitrogen balance
© Nitrogen equilibrium

© Positive nitrogen balance

That's right!

Rationale

Based on protein intake, the expected finding during a period of starvation is a negative nitrogen balance.
Negative nitrogen balance occurs when more nitrogen is excreted from the body than is retained from dietary
protein sources. A zero nitrogen balance or nitrogen equilibrium occurs when the body’s use of proteins is

equal to their excretion. A positive nitrogen balance occurs when more nitrogen is retained in the body than

excreted.

pp. 44
Question 25

What influences the body’s requirements for protein? Select all that apply. One, some, or

all responses may be correct.

@ [By] Illness
@ |B Tissue growth

[| Water intake

[| Low vitamin D

@ [B) Quality of dietary protein

That's right!

Rationale

Influences on the body’s requirements for protein include illness, tissue growth, and quality of dietary protein.
High protein intake increases water intake needs, but water intake does not influence protein requirements.

Low vitamin D does not influence protein requirements.

p. 52
Question 26

Which body function does protein support? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [BB] pH balance
iv) [ml] Fluid balance

iv) [ml] Immune system functioning
|_| Primary energy source
@ [B] Metabolism and transport

That's right!

Rationale

Protein supports pH balance, fluid balance, immune system functioning, and metabolism and transport. The

primary energy source is carbohydrates; protein is used as a backup energy source in times of need.

p. 45
Question 27

How does protein help maintain pH balance?
@ ©@ Acts as a buffering agent

© Increases the uptake of hydrogen ions
O Influences the release of carbonic acid

© Stimulates the renal system’s uptake of base

That's right!

Rationale

Protein helps maintain pH balance by acting as a buffering agent. The unique structure of proteins contains a
combination of a carboxyl acid group and a base group, which allow them to act as buffering agents by
releasing or taking up excess acid in the body. Protein does not increase the uptake of hydrogen ions,
influence the release of carbonic acid, or stimulate the renal system’s uptake of base.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten

p. 45
Question 28

By which process does protein control water balance in the body?
© Active diffusion

iv) © Osmotic pressure

O Passive diffusion

O Hydrostatic pressure

That's right!

Rationale

Protein controls water balance in the body through osmotic pressure. Because water is attracted to protein,
plasma proteins such as albumin help control water balance throughout the body by exerting osmotic
pressure. The pressure maintains the normal circulation of tissue fluids in the appropriate compartments.
Active diffusion, passive diffusion, and hydrostatic pressure are not contributing factors directly involved in
protein and water balance.

p. 45
Question 29

Which factor is most important to consider when following a vegetarian diet?

O A vegetarian diet is not appropriate during pregnancy.
@ ©@ Awell-balanced diet from a variety of foods should be consumed.
©) Plant-based diets are better for the earth than animal-based diets.

© Itis difficult to get a balanced amount of the indispensable amino acids.

That's right!

Rationale

To reap the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle, one must consume a well-balanced diet from a variety of foods. A
well-balanced vegetarian diet can meet dietary recommendations for all essential nutrients; therefore
vegetarian diets are appropriate throughout all stages of life, including pregnancy. The Academy of Nutrition
and Dietetics notes that plant-based diets are better for the earth than animal-based diets, but this is not the
most important factor to consider when choosing to follow a vegetarian diet. A balanced vegetarian eating
pattern, along with the body’s small reserve of amino acids, ensures an overall amino acid balance, as long as
a sufficient amount of varied foods are consumed to meet the normal nutrient and energy needs.

Question 30

Which description is associated with kwashiorkor? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

|__| A form of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) that results from a chronic deficiency of many nutrients,
including protein

@ [EB] More common among children age 18 to 24 months who have been breastfed all their lives and then
rapidly weaned

@ [B) Characteristics include fatty liver
|_| Characterized by an emaciated appearance with little or no body fat

@ [BB] Results in stunted growth, a weakened immune system, and poor development

That's right!

Rationale

Kwashiorkor is more common among children age 18 to 24 months who have been breastfed all their lives
and then rapidly weaned. Switching the child from the nutrient-balanced breast milk to a dilute diet of mostly
carbohydrates and small amounts of incomplete protein triggers the condition. Characteristics of kwashiorkor
include generalized edema and fatty liver, resulting from inadequate protein availability to maintain fluid
balance and transport fat away from the liver. Kwashiorkor results in stunted growth, a weakened immune
system, and poor development. Kwashiorkor is a form of PEM that may result from an acute deficiency of
protein. It does not result from a chronic deficiency of many nutrients. It is not characterized by an emaciated

appearance with little or no body fat.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 31

Which agent helps with the task of chemical digestion of proteins in the stomach? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[| Enterokinase

@ IB] Hydrochloric acid
@ [Bm] Pepsin

[| Trypsin

|_| Aminopeptidase

iv) [ml] Rennin

That's right!

Rationale

The chemical digestion of proteins begins in the stomach. The three agents that help with the enzymatic
breakdown of proteins are hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and rennin. Enterokinase is an enzyme produced and
secreted in the duodenum. Trypsin is a protein-splitting enzyme that works in the small intestine to reduce
proteins to shorter-chain polypeptides and dipeptides. Aminopeptidase is an intestinal secretion that splits
protein to complete the breakdown of protein.

Question 32

Which vegetarian diet restricts the consumption of any item originating from or containing
animal products?

O Ovo-vegetarian
O Lacto-vegetarian

O Lacto-ovo-vegetarian

ivy) © Vegan

That's right!

Rationale

Vegans consume no foods originating from or containing animal products. Ovo-vegetarians include eggs as
the only animal foods in their diet. Lacto-vegetarians consume dairy products from animal sources to
complement their basic diet of plant foods. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians follow a food pattern that allows for the
consumption of dairy products and eggs. Their diet excludes beef, poultry, pork, fish, and seafood.

p. 46
Question 33

Which protein is a vital oxygen carrier in the red blood cells?

O Albumin

© Peptide hormones

@ @ Hemoglobin

O Transferrin

That's right!

Rationale
Hemoglobin is the vital oxygen carrier in the red blood cells. Albumin helps in balancing water through

osmotic pressure. Peptide hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, are proteins that play a major function in

the metabolism of glucose. Transferrin is the iron transport protein in blood.

p. 45
Question 34

Which term refers to the five amino acids that the body can synthesize if the necessary
building blocks and enzymes are available versus other amino acids?

@ ©@ Dispensable

© Indispensable
© Conditionally indispensable

© Complete

That's right!

Rationale

Dispensable proteins refers to five amino acids that the body can synthesize from other amino acids if the
necessary building blocks and enzymes are available. Dispensable proteins include alanine, aspartic acid,
asparagine, glutamic acid, and serine. Indispensable amino acids are those that cannot be excluded from the
diet without compromising health because the body cannot manufacture them in sufficient quantity or at all.
These include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and
valine. Conditionally indispensable amino acids (arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline, and tyrosine)
are indispensable when endogenous sources cannot meet the metabolic demands. Complete is not one of the
three classifications of amino acids. Complete proteins contain all nine indispensable amino acids in sufficient
quantity and ratio to meet the body’s needs.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

pp. 42-43
Question 35

In which way does the body handle an excess dietary intake of protein? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

[| Builds muscle

@ |B] Stored as fat
@ [_| Used as energy

|_| Stunts growth

[| Weakens immune system

So close!

Rationale

When dietary protein needs are met, the excess protein is stored as fat or used as energy. Excess protein does
not build muscle, only exercise and the consumption of enough protein to support growth can do that. A diet
deficient in, not with an excess of, protein can result in stunted growth and a weakened immune system.

p. 53
Question 36

Which method is used to rate protein quality according to the amount of indispensable
amino acids contained and the digestibility of the whole protein and also measure the
digestibility of each amino acid in the ileum?

O Protein efficiency ratio rating
© Indicator amino acid oxidation
@ ©@ Digestible indispensable amino acid score

© Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score

That's right!

Rationale

The digestible indispensable amino acid score rates protein quality according to the amount of indispensable
amino acids contained and the digestibility of the whole protein and measures the digestibility of each amino
acid in the ileum. Protein efficiency ratio rating is based on the weight gain of a growing test animal in
relation to its intake of a specific protein source. Indicator amino acid oxidation assumes that when a protein
source is deficient in any indispensable amino acid that oxidation of all amino acids will prevent them from
contributing to the amino acid pool for protein use in the body. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid
score is similar to the digestible indispensable amino acid score, but it does not measure the digestibility of
each amino acid in the ileum.

p. 52
Question 37

Which characteristic is associated with both kwashiorkor and marasmus? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |] Stunted growth

@ [B] Poor development
tx} [ml] Generalized edema

|_| Little or no body fat
@ |B] Weakened immune system

So close!

Rationale

Kwashiorkor and marasmus both result in stunted growth and poor development. A weakened immune
system is also a result shared by kwashiorkor and marasmus. Generalized edema is a hallmark of kwashiorkor;
contrarily, marasmus presents as an emaciated appearance with little or no body fat.

p. 53
Question 38

Which group has the highest risk for malnutrition?

iv) © Children

© Individuals with liver failure
© Women age 65 years or older

© Older adults living in rural areas

That's right!

Rationale

Children have the highest risk for experiencing malnutrition because of their high nutritive needs during
rapid growth and development. Individuals with high protein needs during infection or disease are at risk for
malnutrition, but they do not have the highest risk. Women age 65 years or older have an increased risk for
malnutrition, but children have a higher risk. Older adults living in rural areas are at risk for malnutrition but
do not have the highest risk.

p. 53
Question 39

Which statement is a recommendation regarding protein-rich foods from the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

@ |B] Consume at least 8 oz of seafood per week from a variety of sources.
[|_| Animal protein should be avoided because it is high in saturated fat and cholesterol.
@ |B] Replace protein-rich foods that are high in sodium and solid fat with more nutrient-dense options.

|_| Protein supplements are necessary because the standard American diet does not provide adequate
protein.

@ [B) Choose a variety of protein-rich foods, including seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans and
peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds.

That's right!

Rationale

Consuming at least 8 oz per week of seafood from a variety of sources is a recommendation from the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans. Protein foods high in sodium and solid fat should be replaced with more nutrient-
dense options, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans
recommends choosing a variety of protein-rich foods, including seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans
and peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Although there are potential health risks associated with
a diet that includes an excessive amount of animal products, the majority of the protein in the standard
American diet comes from animal products; a variety of all food groups should be consumed without
excessive consumption from any one source. The standard American diet provides an adequate amount of

protein, so supplements are not necessary.

Question 40

Which factor influences the body’s requirement for protein? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B Tissue growth
iv) [ml] Illness or disease

|_| Personal preference

@ [| Quality of dietary protein
|_| Dietary guidelines for Americans

So close!

Rationale

Tissue growth influences the body’s requirement for protein, with rapid growth periods requiring more
protein per unit of body weight to build and maintain tissue. During illness and disease, the body’s need for
protein is increased in order to rebuild tissue during the healing process. The quality of dietary protein (i-e.,
bioavailability of protein and its composition of amino acids) also influences the body’s requirement for
protein. Regardless of one’s personal preference for protein-rich foods, a varied and balanced diet is the best
way to obtain quality protein in quantities that meet a healthy person’s needs. Dietary guidelines for
Americans include recommendations regarding protein-rich foods but do not influence the body’s
requirement for protein.

Question 41

ag

Place the steps of chemical digestion of a protein in the correct order.

Hydrochloric acid unfolds and denatures the complex protein
chains.

Pepsin changes large protein into short chains of polypeptides.

Trypsin breaks long protein chains into small polypeptides and
dipeptides.

Chymotrypsin continues the protein-splitting process.

Carboxypeptidase produces small peptides and some free amino
acids.

Aminopeptidase and dipeptidase ready the amino acids to be

absorbed into the bloodstream.

That's right!

Rationale

The chemical digestion of protein begins in the stomach, when gastric secretions begin to break down
proteins. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach unfolds and denatures the complex protein chains. Pepsin,
another gastric secretion, begins splitting the bonds between the protein’s long chain of amino acids, which
changes the large protein into short chains of polypeptides. In the small intestine, trypsin, a pancreatic

Question 42

Which health benefit is provided by a vegetarian diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Improved blood glucose control
|_| lodine level is easily maintained
@ |] Reduced risk of metabolic syndrome
@ [BB] Lower risk of some forms of cancer
|_| Vitamin B 1) is readily found in plant foods

@ |B] Successful weight loss in overweight individuals

That's right!

Rationale

One of the health benefits of a vegetarian diet is improved blood glucose control, resulting in better
management of type 2 diabetes. A vegetarian diet provides lower abnormal metabolic traits, reducing the risk
of metabolic syndrome. The risk of some forms of cancer, like stomach and colorectal cancer, is lowered by
following a vegetarian diet. A vegetarian diet supports successful weight loss in overweight individuals and is
associated with a lower prevalence of obesity. When following a vegetarian diet, it may be difficult to maintain
an appropriate level of iodine because plant-based foods are low in iodine. Because vitamin B j2 is not
naturally found in plant foods, foods that are fortified with B 12 should be consumed.

p. 48
Question 43

In which case would a positive nitrogen balance occur? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

|_| During periods of malnutrition, illness, and starvation
[|_| When the body excretes more nitrogen than it keeps
@ [B] When individuals are recovering from illness or malnutrition
@ [B) During periods of rapid growth, like infancy, childhood, and adolescence

|_| When the body has an inadequate supply of protein and/or total energy

That's right!

Rationale

A positive nitrogen balance occurs in individuals recovering from illness or malnutrition, processes in which
the body retains more nitrogen than it excretes. A positive nitrogen balance is also seen during periods of
rapid growth, such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, and lactation, because the body stores
more nitrogen in the form of protein when building tissue. During periods of malnutrition, illness, and
starvation, the body excretes more nitrogen than it keeps, resulting in a negative nitrogen balance. When
there is an inadequate supply of protein and/or total energy, the body must catabolize tissue to meet other
critical functions, and a negative nitrogen balance occurs.

p. 44
Question 44

Which statement explains why some amino acids are classified as conditionally
indispensable?

© They cannot be made by the body in sufficient quantity or at all.
© They cannot by excluded from the diet without compromising health.
@ @ They must be consumed in the diet in the presence of certain physiologic conditions.

© They can be synthesized by the body if the necessary building blocks and enzymes are available.

That's right!

Rationale

Conditionally indispensable amino acids are normally synthesized by the body, but must be consumed in the
diet in the presence of certain physiologic conditions. Indispensable amino acids cannot be made by the body,
therefore excluding them from the diet will compromise health. Amino acids that can be synthesized by the

body from other amino acids are known as dispensable amino acids.

p. 43
Question 45

Which description is true of dispensable amino acids? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

[| Their functions are nonessential.

@ [BB] They are needed for a healthy life.
@ |B] They are not necessary to obtain in the diet.
|_| They cannot be made by the body.
@ |B) They can be synthesized from other amino acids.

That's right!

Rationale

All amino acids, including dispensable amino acids, are necessary for a healthy life. Dispensable amino acids
are needed, but not necessary to obtain in the diet. Dispensable refers to the five amino acids that the body can
synthesize from other amino acids if the building blocks and enzymes are available. Dispensable amino acids
are essential, meaning that the body cannot make them.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose one or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,
read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

pp. 42-43
Question 46

Which is the role of pepsin in the breakdown of protein? Select all that apply. One, some,
or all responses may be correct.

|_| Acts on the casein of milk
@ |B] Breaks down large protein molecules
@ (] !s activated by hydrochloric acid
© |B] Produces protein-splitting action

iv) [ml] Acts as a protein-specific gastric enzyme

So close!

Rationale

Pepsin is involved in the breakdown of protein by breaking down large protein molecules, becoming activated
by gastric hydrochloric acid, and acting a specific gastric enzyme for protein. Rennin acts on the casein of
milk. Protein splitting occurs in the small intestine.

p. 49
Question 47

What statement made by the nurse demonstrates understanding of the role of rennin in
the absorption of protein?

© "Rennin speeds up the absorption of protein in the stomach."
© "Rennin breaks down protein into amino acids in the stomach."
@ ©@ "Rennin and calcium prevent rapid absorption of milk in an infant."

©) "Rennin increases in adolescence to support the extra need for protein."

That's right!

Rationale

The statement, "Rennin and calcium prevent rapid absorption of milk in an infant" demonstrates
understanding of the role of rennin in protein absorption. Rennin does not speed up the absorption of
protein in the stomach. Rennin does not break down protein into amino acids in the stomach; it works with
calcium to produce a curd to prevent the food from passing too quickly into the small intestine. Rennin is not
present in adolescents; it is only present during infancy and childhood.

p. 49
Question 48

Which enzyme that is involved in the digestion of protein in the small intestine is
responsible for attacking the acid end of the protein?

O Enterokinase

© Chymotrypsin
© Aminopeptidase

@ ©@ Carboxypeptidase

That's right!

Rationale

Carboxypeptidase is involved in the digestion of protein and is responsible for attacking acid in the small
intestine. Enterokinase is secreted by intestinal cells upon food entering the duodenum and activates the
enzyme trypsin. Chymotrypsin continues the protein-splitting action of trypsin. Aminopeptidase completes
the breakdown of protein and polypeptides and frees the remaining amino acids.

Test-Taking Tip: After you have eliminated one or more choices, you may discover that two of the options are
very similar. This can be helpful because it may mean that one of these look-alike answers is the best choice
and the other is a very good distractor. Test both of these options against the stem. Ask yourself which one
completes the incomplete statement grammatically and which one answers the question more fully and
completely. The option that best completes or answers the stem is the one you should choose. Here, too,
pause for a few seconds, give your brain time to reflect, and recall may occur.

p. 50
Question 49

Which chemical is responsible for unfolding and denaturing complex protein chains?

O Proenzymes

@ @ Hydrochloric acid

That's right!

Rationale

Hydrochloric acid is responsible for unfolding and denaturing complex protein chains. Trypsin is an enzyme
produced by the pancreas that continues to break down food after it has moved into the small intestine.
Pepsin is found in the stomach and is converted to pepsinogen to split the bonds between the protein’s long
chain of amino acids, changing the large protein into short chains. Proenzymes are inactive enzymes activated

as needed for protein digestion.

p. 49
Question 50

A nurse is helping an ovo-vegetarian patient select a meal in the hospital. The patient needs

a meal with adequate protein. Which selection is most appropriate for this patient?
O Grilled cheese

iv) © Over-easy eggs
© Baked white fish
O Chicken noodle soup

That's right!

Rationale

The only animal source of protein acceptable in an ovo-vegetarian diet is eggs. Milk products, such as cheese,
are not consumed by an ovo-vegetarian. Fish and poultry are animal proteins not consumed by an ovo-

vegetarian.

p. 46
Question 51

A patient tells the nurse, "| need to order soy milk to get enough protein and cannot have
foods that come from animals." Which type of vegetarian is this patient?

O Lacto-ovo

That's right!

Rationale

Vegan vegetarians follow a strict diet and consume no animal foods. Ovo-vegetarians include eggs in their
diet. Lacto-vegetarians include dairy products from animal sources to complement a basic diet of plant foods.
Lacto-ovo-vegetarians include dairy products and eggs from animal sources.

p. 46
Question 52

Which plant source of protein is the only complete protein that contains all of the
indispensable amino acids?

8 ® Soy

That's right!

Rationale

Soy is the only plant source of complete protein. Eggs are an animal protein. Nuts are of plant origin but are
incomplete proteins. Gelatin is an incomplete animal protein.

p. 45
Question 53

A nurse is educating a vegan patient on a diet that includes adequate protein. What
statement by the nurse is accurate regarding protein in the diet?

@ ©@ “Tofu will be a great choice for you to ensure adequate protein. It has all nine essential amino acids."
© "Foods, such as whole-grain bread and yogurt, contain the protein you will need for a beneficial diet."

© "Eating foods that have the nine essential amino acids, such as cheese and milk, will balance your
diet."

© "You will need to consume soy products because they are rich in dispensable amino acids and are
easily digested."

That's right!

Rationale

Tofu is made from soybean curd and is the best option for adequate protein and essential amino acids for a
vegan who follows strict diets and consumes no animal foods. Vegans do not consume yogurt, which is a dairy
product from an animal source. Vegans do not consume cheese or milk, which are from an animal source. Soy
products are not rich in dispensable amino acids; rather they are abundant with indispensable amino acids.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 45
Question 54

Which food selection provides complete proteins for a vegan patient?

O French toast

O Tuna casserole

ivy) © Rice and beans

O Pasta with tomato sauce

That's right!

Rationale

A combination of grains and legumes, such as rice and beans, will provide complete proteins for the vegan
patient. French toast contains egg, which is not an option for a vegan. A vegan cannot consume fish in the

tuna casserole. Pasta with tomato sauce may be vegan, but it is not a good source of complete proteins.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 45
Question 55

A patient recently became a vegan. The nurse advises the patient to incorporate which
protein-rich food into the new diet? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may

be correct.

iv) [ml] Lentils

[| Skim milk

iv) [ml] Almond butter

That's right!

Rationale
Soy, lentils, and almond butter are appropriate sources of protein for a vegan. Eggs and skim milk come from

animals, so they would not be appropriate for this patient.

p. 46
Question 56

Which combination of foods will the nurse recommend to a vegan patient for a healthy

protein balance?

© Eggs and fish

©) Dairy and eggs

© Fish and poultry
@ @ Grains and legumes

That's right!

Rationale
Combinations of plant foods, such as grains and legumes, will provide all the essential amino acids in the

vegan diet. Eggs, fish, dairy, and poultry are animal sources of protein; vegans will not consume these.

p. 46
Question 57

A vegan patient is asking about complementary proteins in order to consume the nine
essential amino acids in their diet. What suggestion can the nurse make to help the patient
meet protein requirements? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

[_] Sunflower seeds and yogurt
@ [BB Lentil casserole with nut topping
@ |] Garbanzo and sesame seed spread

@ [_ | Split pea soup with sesame seed crackers

[| Corn tortillas with refried beans and cheese

So close!

Rationale

Vegans consume no animal foods and must obtain all of their protein from plant sources. Complementary
protein pairings the nurse can recommend are a lentil casserole with nut topping, garbanzo bean and sesame
seed spread, and split pea soup with sesame seed crackers. Vegans do not consume yogurt or cheese, which

are animal products.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 48
Question 58

Which source of protein is plant-based? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

@ [B) Tofu

@ [mW] Lentils
@ [B) Peanuts
@ [B) Chickpeas

[| Skim milk

That's right!

Rationale

Plant sources of protein include tofu, lentils, peanuts, and chickpeas. Skim milk comes from cows.

p. 45,p. 45
Question 59

A nurse is providing dietary counseling to a lacto-vegetarian patient. Which complementary
food combination is the best choice for providing the necessary amino acids to achieve a
complete protein balance for the patient?

O Falafel and hummus
tx} © Brown rice and beans
@ © Whole-wheat pasta and cheese

O Peanut butter on whole-wheat bread

So close!

Rationale

The complementary food combination that is the best choice for the patient with a lacto-vegetarian diet is
whole-wheat pasta and cheese. Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy products from animal sources, and the whole-
wheat pasta and cheese will provide the necessary amino acids to achieve a complete protein balance for the
patient. Falafel and hummus, brown rice and beans, and peanut butter on whole-wheat bread are excellent
choices for a vegan diet that does not include dairy.

p. 46,p. 46
Question 60

Which protein comes from an animal source?

That's right!

Rationale
Milk is an animal source of protein. Soy, tofu, and pine nuts are all plant sources of protein.

Question 1

In which absorption process in the small intestine does the cell engulf large molecules in

order to absorb them?

iv) © Pinocytosis
O Active transport
© Simple diffusion
© Facilitated diffusion

That's right!

Rationale

Pinocytosis is the engulfing of a large molecule by the cell; materials attach to the cell membrane before the
cell engulfs it. Active transport assists particles to move against their concentration gradient with the help of a
carrier molecule; it does not involve engulfing large molecules. Simple diffusion is the force by which
molecules move from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration, not engulfing
molecules. Facilitated diffusion is a carrier-assisted movement of larger items across the mucosal cell

membrane; it does not involve engulfing large molecules.

p. 66
Question 2

Which genetic disease causes complications for patients despite rigorous treatment?

iv) O Galactosemia

© Celiac disease
© Phenylketonuria

© @ Glycogen-storage diseases

So close!

Rationale

Despite rigorous treatment of adhering to a strict galactose-free diet, patients with galactosemia generally
experience complications, such as cognitive disability, speech problems, neurologic and/or movement
disorders, and ovarian dysfunction, at some point in life. Celiac disease is an allergy to the protein gluten and
is not a genetic disorder. Phenylketonuria can cause severe irreversible brain damage and central nervous
system damage if left untreated but can be controlled by a low-phenylalanine diet consisting of a special
supplemental nutrition formula. Glycogen-storage diseases are controlled by dietary treatment to avoid
hypoglycemia.

Question 3

Which statement describes the Krebs cycle? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [BB] It takes place in the mitochondria of the cell.

@ |B] Energy is converted into a form the body can use.

© |B] Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced at a consistent rate.
|_| It is the sum of chemical reactions that occur within a cell.

@ [_| Catabolic and anabolic reactions occur to supply cells with ATP.

So close!

Rationale

The Krebs cycle is the hub of energy production that occurs in the mitochondria of the cell. The mitochondria
convert energy into a form the body can use. The combined processes of metabolism, catabolism, and
anabolism occur in the Krebs cycle to ensure that the body has much needed energy in the form of ATP. ATP is
not produced at a consistent rate; its production fluctuates depending on the energy needs at a given time.
The Krebs cycle is not the sum of chemical reactions that occur within a cell; this is the definition of
metabolism.

Question 4

If phenylketonuria is left untreated, which consequence is possible? Select all that apply.

One, some, or all responses may be correct.
iv) [ml] Convulsive seizures

@ [BB] Psychiatric disorders
@ [B] Developmental problems

@ [BB] Irreversible brain damage

@ [BB] Central nervous system damage

That's right!

Rationale

If left untreated phenylketonuria may cause convulsive seizures, psychiatric disorders, developmental

problems, irreversible brain damage, and central nervous system damage.

pp. 69-70
Question 5

Which digestive alteration is a food allergy that causes cellular destruction of the

gastrointestinal tract lining?

O Galactosemia
iv) © Celiac disease
© Phenylketonuria

O Lactose intolerance

That's right!

Rationale

Celiac disease is a food allergy to the protein gluten, which causes destruction of the gastrointestinal tract
lining. Galactosemia is a genetic disease, not a food allergy. Phenylketonuria is a genetic disease, not a food
allergy. Lactose intolerance is a deficiency of disaccharidases in the small intestines and can cause abdominal

cramping and diarrhea.

@ |B] Vitamins and minerals are liberated.
@ |B] Carbohydrates are reduced to monosaccharides.
@ [BB] Individual amino acids are freed from complex proteins.

@ |B] Fatty acids and monoglycerides are freed from triglycerides.
@ [_] The food-derived mass has been converted to whole fluid.

So close!

Rationale

The process of simplifying whole food into molecules small enough for absorption requires vitamins and
minerals to be liberated. When digestion is complete, carbohydrates are reduced to monosaccharides. The
process of digestion frees individual acids from complex proteins, and fatty acids and monoglycerides are
freed from triglycerides. With a water base for solution and transport, in addition to the necessary electrolytes,
the whole fluid food-derived mass is primed for absorption.

Question 7

Which gastrointestinal secretion assists in carrying the products of digestion through the
gastrointestinal tract?

© Bile
tx} © Mucus
O Enzymes

@ © Water and electrolytes
© Hydrochloric acid and buffer ions

So close!

Rationale

Water and electrolytes assist in carrying the products of digestion through the gastrointestinal tract into the
tissues. Bile emulsifies fat into smaller pieces to expose more surface area for the actions of fat-splitting
enzymes. Mucus lubricates and protects the mucosal tissues that line the gastrointestinal tract and help
moisten the food mass. Digestive enzymes are responsible for breaking down nutrients. Hydrochloric acid
and buffer ions are needed to produce the correct pH (i.e., the degree of acidity or alkalinity) that is necessary
for enzymatic activity.

p. 60
Question 8

Which information would be included when teaching a patient about gastroesophageal

reflux? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B] Gastroesophageal reflux is commonly called heartburn.

|_| The uncomfortable sensations originate in the heart.
@ [BB] A sphincter in the stomach may not be working properly.
@ |B] Acid-mixed food may be seeping back into the esophagus.
@ [By A hiatal hernia may be the cause of gastroesophageal reflux.

That's right!

Rationale

Gastroesophageal reflux is commonly called heartburn. When the gastroesophageal sphincter is working
properly, it prevents acid-mixed food from seeping from the stomach back into the esophagus. One cause of
gastroesophageal reflux is a hiatal hernia, which occurs when part of the stomach protrudes upward into the
chest cavity. Heartburn has nothing to do with the heart, but it was so named because the sensations are

perceived as originating in the region of the heart.

p. 60
Question 9

Which description explains why the metabolism of glucose yields less energy than the
metabolism of fat?

© Fat has fewer kilocalories per gram compared with carbohydrates.
@ ©@ Carbohydrates have fewer kilocalories per gram compared with fat.
© Metabolism of fat yields more nitrogen waste compared with glucose.

© Metabolism of glucose yields more nitrogen waste compared with glucose.

That's right!

Rationale

The metabolism of glucose yields less energy than the metabolism of fat because carbohydrates have 4 kcal/g
and fat has 9 kcal/g. Fat does not have fewer kilocalories per gram compared with carbohydrates. The use of
protein as a source of energy is inefficient and yields extra nitrogen waste. Metabolism of fat and glucose does
not yield extra nitrogen waste.

p. 69
Question 10

Which process is a function of the liver? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses

may be correct.

@ [BB] Bile production

@ [B] Regulation of blood glucose levels
iv) [ml] Metabolism of hormones and medications
iv) [ml] Conversion of excess ammonia to urea

@ [BB] Synthesis of proteins and blood-clotting factors

That's right!

Rationale

Bile production, regulation of blood glucose levels, metabolism of hormones and medications, conversion of
excess ammonia to urea, and synthesis of proteins and blood-clotting factors are all major functions of the

liver.

p. 63
Question 11

Which secreted substance facilitates swallowing of the food bolus during chemical
digestion in the mouth and esophagus?

ivy) © Mucous material

That's right!

Rationale

The salivary glands secrete a mucous material that lubricates and binds food particles to facilitate the
swallowing of each food bolus. Lingual lipase is secreted by small glands at the back of the tongue, and
during infancy this enzyme helps with the digestion of milk fat. Gastrin is a hormone found in gastric
secretions that helps with chemical digestion in the stomach. Salivary amylase, secreted by the salivary glands,
is a starch-splitting enzyme.

p. 60
Question 12

Which result is the consequence of decreased hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [BB] Increases the bacterial load
@ |B] Reduces the activation of pepsinogen
|_| Makes the stomach content very acidic
@ [BB] Potentially alters the digestive process of protein
@ [| Reduces the bioavailability of vitamins and minerals

So close!

Rationale

Because hydrochloric acid kills microorganisms in the stomach, decreased secretion will increase the bacterial
load. Decreased secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach will reduce the activation of pepsinogen. The
digestive process of protein may be altered if the secretion of hydrochloric acid is decreased, because
hydrochloric acid begins the digestive process of protein. Situations that decrease hydrochloric acid in the
stomach will reduce the bioavailability of vitamin B 12, calcium, iron, and magnesium further along in the

digestive process. Stomach content is normally very acidic because the release of hydrochloric acid lowers the
pH.

p.61
Question 13

In which way does the intramural nerve plexus assist the gastrointestinal system to move

food along the digestive pathway? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may
be correct.

tx} [ml] Peristalsis forces contents forward
@ [B] Controls muscle tone in the gastrointestinal (Gl) wall
iv) [ml] Coordinates all of the various movements

[| Tonic contraction ensures valve control

@ |B] Regulates rate and intensity of muscle contractions

So close!

Rationale

Muscle tone in the gastrointestinal wall is controlled by the intramural nerve plexus. The intramural nerve
plexus is responsible for coordinating all movements within the gastrointestinal wall. The rate and intensity of
muscle contractions is regulated by the intramural nerve plexus. The layers of smooth muscle in the
gastrointestinal wall are responsible for peristalsis, forcing contents forward in the gastrointestinal tract. Tonic
contraction is a type of movement provided by the smooth muscle.

p. 59
Question 14

Which condition is a food allergy that can affect the normal functioning of the
gastrointestinal tract?

iv) © Celiac disease

O Lactose intolerance
O Galactosemia

© Phenylketonuria

That's right!

Rationale

Celiac disease is an allergy to the protein gluten. Lactose intolerance is due to insufficient lactase and is an
error in digestion, not a food allergy. Galactosemia is not a food allergy; it is a genetic disease caused by a
missing enzyme that alters normal carbohydrate metabolism. Phenylketonuria is a rare autosomal recessive
genetic disorder and is not considered a food allergy.

p.71
Question 15

Which factor influences the rate of stomach-emptying time at the pyloric valve?
© Gastric lipase

O Protein content

@ ©@ Caloric density

© Volume of chyme

That's right!

Rationale

The caloric density of the food influences the rate of stomach-emptying time at the pyloric valve. Gastric

lipase, protein content, and volume of chyme do not influence the stomach-emptying time of chyme at the
pyloric valve.

p. 60
Question 16

What effect does hydrochloric acid have on minerals?

O Breaks down minerals
O Activates minerals

© Transports minerals
@ ©@ Aids in the absorption of minerals

That's right!

Rationale

Hydrochloric acid aids in the absorption of minerals. Hydrochloric acid is unable to break down, activate, or
transport minerals.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 60
Question 17

Which process moves glucose across a cell membrane?

iv) © Active transport
© Filtration

O Facilitated diffusion

© Colloid osmotic pressure

That's right!

Rationale

Glucose enters absorbing cells through an active transport mechanism that involves sodium as a partner.
Filtration is a form of a passive transport by which water and molecules move down a hydrostatic pressure
gradient. Colloid osmotic pressure is a pressure exerted by proteins in the blood vessels that maintain a fluid
balance between the plasma and interstitial fluid. Facilitated diffusion makes use of a protein channel for the

carrier-assisted movement of larger items across the mucosal cell membrane.

pp. 66-67
Question 18

When the amount of food consumed yields more energy than is needed, in which way is
the remaining energy stored for use by the body? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

|_| Excess protein is stored as muscle in the body.
|_| Excess kilocalories are wasted because they cannot be stored.
@ [BB] Excess protein is broken down into glucose or fat for storage.
@ |B] Excess glucose is stored as glycogen for quick energy when required.

@ |B] Excess energy from carbohydrates is stored as fat in adipose tissue.

That's right!

Rationale

Excess protein is broken down by removing the nitrogen unit and converting the remaining carbon chain into
glucose or fat for storage. Through glycogenesis, extra glucose is converted to glycogen and stored to be used
for quick energy when needed. Excess energy from carbohydrates is stored as fat in adipose tissue and is
available for use when required. Excess protein is not stored as muscle in the body but instead is broken down
into glucose or fat for storage. Kilocalories consumed in excess of energy needs are not wasted but are

converted for storage.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 69
Question 19

Which process must occur before the body can convert macronutrients into needed energy
or store them for later use? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

|_| Conversion of macronutrients to adenosine triphosphate
@ [| Breakdown of macronutrients into their respective building blocks
@ [BB] Absorption of macronutrients into the bloodstream or the lymphatic system
© [BB] Dispersion of macronutrients throughout the body to perform their critical functions

[| Conversion of micronutrients to monosaccharides, amino acids, and fatty acids

So close!

Rationale

Macronutrients must be broken down into their respective building blocks and absorbed into the bloodstream
or lymphatic system before they are converted into energy or stored. Macronutrients are not converted
directly to adenosine triphosphate because they must first be broken down and absorbed. Micronutrients, not
macronutrients, are available for absorption and are dispersed throughout the body to perform their critical
functions. Macronutrients, not micronutrients, are broken down into building blocks like monosaccharides,
amino acids, and fatty acids.

Test-Taking Tip: If you are unable to answer a multiple-choice question immediately, eliminate the alternatives
that you know are incorrect and proceed from that point. The same goes for a multiple-response question that
requires you to choose two or more of the given alternatives. If a fill-in-the-blank question poses a problem,
read the situation and essential information carefully and then formulate your response.

p. 68
Question 20

Which gastrointestinal secretion is responsible for producing the correct degree of acidity
or alkalinity necessary for enzymatic activity?

© Water and electrolytes
@ ©@ Hydrochloric acid and buffer ions

That's right!

Rationale

Hydrochloric acid and buffer ions are needed to produce the correct pH (i.e., the degree of acidity or alkalinity)
that is necessary for enzymatic activity. Bile emulsifies fat into smaller pieces to expose more surface area for
the actions of fat-splitting enzymes. Mucus lubricates and protects the mucosal tissues that line the
gastrointestinal tract and help moisten the food mass. Digestive enzymes are responsible for breaking down
nutrients. Water and electrolytes assist in carrying the products of digestion through the gastrointestinal tract
into the tissues.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly

Question 21

Which action is an example of catabolism? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

|_| Glycerol is converted to fat.

@ [BB] Fat is converted to fatty acids.

@ |B] Protein is converted to amino acids.
|_| Amino acids are converted to protein.

@ |B] Carbohydrates are converted to glucose.

That's right!

Rationale

The conversion of fat to fatty acids is an example of catabolism. The breakdown of protein into amino acids is
an example of catabolism. Catabolism occurs when carbohydrates are converted to glucose. Glycerol is not

converted to fat. Amino acids are not converted to protein.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 69
Question 22

Which factor determines a nutrient’s bioavailability? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

@ [BB] The form in which the nutrient is present

© [BB] If the food-derived mass is primed for absorption

@ |B] The competition among nutrients for common absorptive sites
@ |B] The amount of nutrient present in the gastrointestinal tract

© [BB] The point of absorption, which acts as a gatekeeper

So close!

Rationale

The form in which the nutrient is present is one factor that determines a nutrient’s bioavailability. One of the
factors that determines a nutrient’s bioavailability is the competition among nutrients for common absorptive
sites. The amount of nutrient present in the gastrointestinal tract is a factor that determines a nutrient’s
bioavailability. The whole fluid, food-derived mass is ready for absorption before the nutrient’s bioavailability is
determined. The point of absorption becomes the vital gatekeeper that determines how much of a nutrient is
available for cellular use; it does not determine the actual bioavailability of the nutrient.

pp. 63, 65
Question 23

Which gastrointestinal secretion lubricates and protects the tissues that line the
gastrointestinal (Gl) tract and helps moisten the food mass?

O Bile
iv) © Mucus

© Hydrochloric acid
© Electrolytes

That's right!

Rationale

Mucus lubricates and protects the mucosal tissues that line the GI tract and helps moisten the food mass.
Bile, hydrochloric acid, and electrolytes do not lubricate mucosal tissues or help to moisten the food mass.
Bile emulsifies fat into smaller pieces to expose more surface area for the actions of fat-splitting enzymes.
Hydrochloric acid and buffer ions produce the correct pH needed for enzymatic activity. Water and electrolytes
help carry the products of digestion through the Gl tract into the tissues.

Test-Taking Tip: Never leave a question unanswered. Even if answering is no more than an educated guess on
your part, go ahead and mark an answer. You might be right, but if you leave it blank, you will certainly be

wrong and lose precious points.

p. 59
Question 24

Which term refers to the movement of intestinal muscles that slowly pushes the food mass
forward, sometimes with long, sweeping waves over the entire length of the intestine?

O Pendular movements
© Longitudinal rotation

O Surface villi motions

ivy) © Peristaltic waves

That's right!

Rationale

Peristaltic waves refers to the movement of intestinal muscles that slowly pushes the food mass forward,
sometimes with long, sweeping waves over the entire length of the intestine. Pendular movements from
small, local intestinal muscles sweep back and forth, thereby stirring the chyme at the mucosal surface.
Longitudinal rotation by long muscles that run the length of the intestine rolls the slowly moving food mass
in a spiral motion to mix it and expose new surfaces for absorption. Surface villi motions stir and mix the
chyme at the intestinal wall, thereby exposing additional nutrients for absorption.

p.61
Question 25

In response to a low pH in the duodenum, which hormone stimulates the pancreatic

release of bicarbonate to increase the pH to an alkaline environment?

© Cholecystokinin
© Gastric inhibitory peptide

ivy) © Secretin

That's right!

Rationale

In response to a low pH in the duodenum, secretin stimulates the pancreatic release of bicarbonate to
increase the pH to an alkaline environment. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone secreted from the mucosal
epithelium of the small intestine in response to the presence of fat and certain amino acids in chyme. CCK
inhibits gastric motility, increases the release of pancreatic enzymes, and stimulates the gallbladder to secrete
bile into the small intestine. Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is a hormone secreted from the enterocytes of the
duodenum and jejunum in response to the presence of glucose and fat. GIP stimulates insulin secretion from
the pancreas and inhibits gastric motility. The hormone gastrin stimulates parietal cells within the lining of

the stomach to secrete hydrochloric acid.

p. 62
Question 26

A deficiency of which substance causes an intolerance to milk and dairy products?

iv) © Lactase

That's right!

Rationale

A deficiency of lactase inhibits the breakdown of the milk sugar lactose, which causes an intolerance to milk
and dairy products. A deficiency of sucrase or maltase may produce a wide range of gastrointestinal problems
and abdominal pain because the body cannot digest the specific sugar involved but does not cause lactose
intolerance. A deficiency in insulin production causes hyperglycemia, not lactose intolerance.

p.71
Question 27

Nutrients that do not need the help of a specific protein channel to move across a mucosal

cell wall are transferred by which process?

O Osmosis
O Pinocytosis
@ @ Simple diffusion

O Passive transport

That's right!

Rationale

Nutrients that do not need the help of a specific protein channel to move across a mucosal cell wall do so by
simple diffusion. In simple diffusion, the particles move from an area of greater concentration to an area of
lesser concentration. Water is transferred by osmosis. Pinocytosis occurs when the penetration of a larger
material attaches to a thicker cell membrane and is engulfed by the cell. Passive transport does not require

energy to cross a cell membrane.

Question 28

Which food group interferes with zinc and iron absorption when consumed in high

quantities?

That's right!

Rationale
When consumed in high quantities, grains can interfere with zinc and iron absorption. The phytic acid found
in grain products decreases the bioavailability of both iron and zinc by binding to the minerals and preventing

absorption. Fats, dairy, and meats do not interfere with zinc and iron absorption.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 65
Question 29

When digestion is complete, to which product are carbohydrates reduced in order to be
absorbed into the body?

@ @ Galactose
© Fatty acid
© Glyceride
© Amino acid

That's right!

Rationale
When digestion is complete, carbohydrates are reduced to galactose in order to be absorbed into the body.
Fatty acids and glycerides are reduced forms of fat. Protein is reduced to amino acids in order to be absorbed

into the body.

Test-Taking Tip: Sometimes the reading of a question in the middle or toward the end of an exam may trigger

your mind with the answer or provide an important clue to an earlier question.

p. 62
Question 30

Where does intestinal gas form in the gastrointestinal tract?

iv) © Colon
O Rectum

O Duodenum

O Jejunum

That's right!

Rationale

Intestinal gas forms in the colon. The rectum is the part of the gastrointestinal tract from which the gas is
expelled from the body. The duodenum and jejunum are areas of the small intestine not involved in gas
formation.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice

Question 31

Which small intestinal movement results in the progressive chopping of a food mass into

soft lumps, mixing it with gastrointestinal secretions?

O Surface villi motions
O Pendular movements

O Peristaltic waves

ivy) © Segmentation rings

That's right!

Rationale

Segmentation rings are the alternating contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles in the small
intestine, resulting in the progressive chopping of food mass into soft lumps, mixing it with gastrointestinal
secretions. Surface villi stir and mix chyme at the intestinal wall. Pendular movements from small local
muscles sweep back and forth, stirring the chyme at the mucosal surface. Peristaltic waves slowly push the
food mass forward.

Test-Taking Tip: Sometimes the reading of a question in the middle or toward the end of an exam may trigger
your mind with the answer or provide an important clue to an earlier question.

p.61
Question 32

What is the function of the mucous glands that line the esophagus?
© Breaking down food

© Absorbing nutrients
@ © Moving food toward the stomach
© ©@ Lubricating and binding food

So close!

Rationale

The mucous glands that line the esophagus help move food toward the stomach. They do not play a role in
breaking down food or absorbing nutrients. The salivary glands secrete mucus that lubricates and binds food.

p. 60
Question 33

In what part of the gastrointestinal tract is chyme formed?

O Duodenum

That's right!

Rationale

Chyme is formed in the antrum, the lower portion of the stomach. The fundus is the upper portion of the
stomach, and the pylorus is the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. The duodenum is the
beginning of the small intestine.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

Question 34

Which statement explains the reason a patient develops heartburn?

@ @ The sphincter of the stomach is not working properly.
© Part of the stomach is pushing down into the chest cavity.
© The sphincter of the stomach is not allowing the food to move through.

© Eating while reclined is interfering with the food staying in the stomach.

That's right!

Rationale

The most accurate explanation is that the sphincter of the stomach is not working properly. When the
gastroesophageal sphincter is not working properly, it may allow acid-mixed food to seep back into the
esophagus from the stomach, resulting in reflux or heartburn. "Part of the stomach is pushing down into the
chest cavity" is an inaccurate description of a hiatal hernia that can cause heartburn. The stomach is
protruding upward into the chest cavity, not downward. "The sphincter of the stomach is not allowing the
food to move through" is inaccurate because acid would not be moving up into the esophagus since nothing
could pass through. "Eating while reclined is interfering with the food staying in the stomach" does happens
in hiatal hernia or reflux, but it is not the underlying cause of heartburn.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

Question 35

Place the organs of the gastrointestinal system in the correct sequence in which digestion

occurs.

iv) 1. Oropharynx

iv) 2. Esophagus

3. Stomach

4. Liver

5. Pancreas

6. Small and large intestines

That's right!

Rationale

Digestion begins when the food enters the oropharyngeal cavity. Mastication breaks down the food into small
particles, and saliva amylase begins to digest carbohydrates. The chewed food forms a ball called a bolus,
which passes through the esophagus to the stomach via peristalsis. Once in the stomach, digestive juices kill
bacteria, and enzymes break down proteins. The liver secretes bile to break down fats. Next, the pancreas is
stimulated, resulting in the secretion of more digestive enzymes. Food mixed with bile from the liver and

stimulated, resulting in the secretion of more digestive enzymes. Food mixed with bile from the liver and
enzymes from the pancreas enters the small intestine for absorption. The final phase of digestion occurs as
indigestible food and water are processed, stored, and dispersed by the large intestine.

Test-Taking Tip: In this question type, you are asked to prioritize (put in order) the options presented. For
example, you might be asked the steps of performing an action or skill such as those involved in medication
administration.

p. 68
Question 36

Where does the breakdown of fat begin, and which enzyme is involved in the breakdown?

© Stomach, protease
@ @ Mouth, lipase
© Mouth, amylase
© Stomach, hydrochloric acid

That's right!

Rationale

The breakdown of fat begins in the mouth and involves the enzyme lipase. In the stomach, protease is a
general name for a protein-splitting enzyme. Amylase is released in the mouth, but it is a starch-splitting
enzyme. Hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment in the stomach for gastric enzymes to work.

Question 37

Which mechanical digestive process occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract? Select all
that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

iv) [| Peristalsis

[| Emulsification

iv) [ml] Mastication

|_| Salivary gland secretion
@ [| Muscle movement

So close!

Rationale

Peristalsis, mastication, and muscle movement occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Emulsification is the
chemical, not mechanical, breakdown of fat. Salivary gland secretion promotes chemical, not mechanical,
digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

pp. 58, 60
Question 38

How is glucose produced in the small intestine?
@ @ Glucose is derived from a disaccharide.

© Trypsin splits the protein molecule into glucose.
© Adisaccharide molecule results in glucose.

©) Dipeptidase converts carbohydrates to glucose.

That's right!

Rationale

Glucose is produced in the small intestine when the sucrose disaccharide is reduced to two monosaccharides,
glucose and fructose. Trypsin does not split a protein molecule into glucose. Glucose is obtained from
carbohydrates. Glucose is not a result of a disaccharide molecule. Dipeptidase splits dipeptides into amino

acids.

p. 62
Question 39

How does secretin aid in digestion?

© Secretin is a starch-splitting enzyme.
@ ©@ Secretin controls the acidity of the small intestine.
© Secretin is responsible for signaling the release of bile.

© Secretin increases the release of pancreatic enzymes.

That's right!

Rationale

Secretin controls the acidity in the small intestine by stimulating the pancreatic release of bicarbonate to
increase the pH to an alkaline environment, which is necessary for the activity of the pancreatic enzymes.
Secretin is a hormone, and amylase is a starch-splitting enzyme. Cholecystokinin is secreted when fat is
present and triggers the release of bile from the gallbladder to emulsify fat. Cholecystokinin inhibits gastric
mobility and increases the release of pancreatic enzymes.

p. 62
Question 40

Which process does the intramural nerve plexus regulate in the gastrointestinal tract?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[| Gastric secretion
iv) [ml] Muscle movement
iv) [ml] Muscle contraction

[| Mucus secretion

[| Hormonal release

That's right!

Rationale

The intramural nerve plexus regulates muscle movement and contraction. Gastric secretion, hormonal
release, and mucus secretion are stimulated by food, motility, and other chemical reactions.

p. 59
Question 41

Where does maximal digestion of nutrients occur in the gastrointestinal system?

O Stomach

That's right!

Rationale

Maximal digestion of nutrients occurs in the jejunum. Only a few nutrients are absorbed in the ileum. Water,
potassium, and sodium absorption occur in the colon. The stomach absorbs alcohol, which is not a nutrient.

@ (BB) Activating the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum

|_| Moving digestive nutrients into the mucosa of the small intestine

So close!

Rationale

When released in the small intestine, cholecystokinin inhibits gastric hydrochloric acid secretion, initiates
pancreatic exocrine secretion, and activates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum. Cholecystokinin
does not increase peristalsis or move digestive nutrients into the mucosa of the small intestine.

Question 43

In which state are vitamins when digestion is complete?

iv) © Liberated

O Bioavailable
O Macronutrient

O Bound to a carrier

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamins are in a liberated state when digestion is complete. Bioavailability is the ability of the vitamin to be
absorbed and is dependent on multiple factors. Vitamins are micronutrients; macronutrients are nutrients
required in larger quantities, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Not all vitamins are bound to a

carrier.

p. 62
Question 44

Lacteals support nutrient absorption through which function?

© Promoting the uptake of protein
© Enhancing the reception of carbohydrates
@ © Providing a route for fat-soluble nutrients to enter the lymphatic system

© Increasing the surface area of the intestine to promote absorption

That's right!

Rationale

Lacteals are lymph capillaries that support nutrient absorption by absorbing fat-soluble nutrients. The villi in
the small intestine have an ample supply of blood vessels to receive protein and carbohydrate materials. Villi
also increase the exposed surface area of the intestine.

p. 68
Question 45

Which type of transport occurs when particles move against their concentration gradient?
O Pinocytosis
iv) © Active transport

O Facilitated diffusion
O Passive diffusion

That's right!

Rationale

Active transport occurs when particles move against their concentration gradient. Pinocytosis occurs when a
nutrient contacts a villi membrane, which then surrounds and encompasses it. Facilitated diffusion occurs
when, despite positive pressure flow, molecules are unable to pass through membrane pores unless aided.
Passive diffusion occurs when the pressure is greater on one side of the membrane, and the substance moves

from the area of greater pressure to an area of lesser pressure.

pp. 66-67
Question 46

Fatty materials have to pass through the lymph before entering the bloodstream for which

reason?

O They require active transport.
@ @ They are not water soluble.

© The fatty materials are too large.
© The lymph further breaks down the fatty acid.

That's right!

Rationale
Fatty materials have to pass through the lymph before being absorbed in the thoracic duct because they are
not water soluble. The fatty materials do not require active transport; they are not too large, and they are

broken down before being absorbed into the lymph.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal

the correct answer.

p. 68
Question 47

In which section of the gastrointestinal tract does the absorption of water take place?
©) Stomach

O Duodenum

O Jejunum
@ @ Colon

That's right!

Rationale

Most of the water that enters the large intestine is absorbed in the first half of the colon. Water is not
absorbed in the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum. The stomach is an absorption site for material such as
alcohol. The absorption of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc occur in the duodenum. The

jejunum is the site for absorption of water-soluble vitamins.

p. 67
Question 48

Which anatomic structure is an important part of the intestinal wall surface that is adapted
to ensure maximal absorption of essential nutrients in the digestive process? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B) Mucosal folds
@ (mi) villi
@ [By Nicrovilli

[|_| Fundus

[| Hepatocytes

That's right!

Rationale

Three important structures of the intestinal wall surface are particularly adapted to ensure the maximal
absorption of essential nutrients in the digestive process. Mucosal folds are the large, visible folds of the
mucous lining of the small intestine that increase the absorbing surface area. Villi are finger-like projections
that cover the mucosal surfaces of the small intestine, which further increases the absorbing surface area.
Microvilli are extremely small, hair-like projections that cover all of the villi on the surface of the small
intestine, greatly increasing the total absorbing surface area. The fundus and hepatocytes are not anatomic
structures of the of the intestinal wall surface. Fundus is the upper portion of the stomach. Hepatocytes are

functional cells of the liver.

pp. 65-66
Question 49

Which description defines glycogenolysis, a metabolic function of the liver?

© Breaking down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol
@ ©@ Breaking down stored glycogen into individual glucose units
© Breaking down glucose into pyruvate

© Converting noncarbohydrate substances into glucose

That's right!

Rationale

Glycogenolysis is the breaking down of stored glycogen into individual glucose units. Lipolysis is the breaking
down of lipids into fatty acids and glycerol. Glycolysis is the breaking down of glucose into pyruvate.
Gluconeogenesis is the converting of noncarbohydrate substances into glucose.

Test-Taking Tip: The presence of absolute words and phrases can also help you determine the correct answer
to a multiple-choice item. If answer choices contain an absolute (e.g., none, never, must, cannot), be very
cautious. Remember that there are not many things in the world that are absolute, and in an area as complex
as nursing, an absolute may be a reason to eliminate it from consideration as the best choice. This is only a
guideline and should not be taken to be true 100% of the time; however, it can help you reduce the number

of choices.

Question 50

Which material in the gastric secretions helps with chemical digestion in the stomach?

Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

[| Pancreatic enzymes

@ |B) Acid
@ |) Gastric enzymes
@ [| Mucus

|_| Bile

So close!

Rationale

The gastric secretions contain three types of materials that help with chemical digestion in the stomach: acid,
mucus, and gastric enzymes. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach creates the necessary degree of acidity for
gastric enzymes to work, activates the first protease (pepsinogen), and aids in the absorption of several
vitamins and minerals. Pepsin is a gastric enzyme that aids in splitting proteins. Mucus protects the stomach
lining from the erosive effect of hydrochloric acid. Mucus also helps bind, mix, and move the food mass along

the GI tract. Pancreatic enzymes and bile aid in chemical digestion in the small intestine.

p. 60
Question 51

Which network of nerves, extending from the esophagus to the anus, is located in the
gastrointestinal (Gl) wall?

© Myenteric plexus

@ ©@ Intramural nerve plexus
© Submucous plexus

© Cervical plexus

That's right!

Rationale

The intramural nerve plexus is the complex network of nerves in the GI wall that extend from the esophagus
to the anus and regulates the muscular action along the Gl tract. The myenteric plexus is situated between the
circular muscle layer and the longitudinal muscle layer in the lower esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The
submucous plexus is located in the submucosal tissue in the intestinal walls. The cervical plexus serves the
neck, shoulders, and head.

p. 59
Question 52

Which term refers to the movement of nutrients through the circulatory system from one
area of the body to another?

O Digestion
© Absorption

ivy) © Transport

O Metabolism

That's right!

Rationale

Transport is the movement of nutrients through the circulatory system from one area of the body to another.
Digestion is the process by which food is broken down in the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract. Absorption is the
process by which nutrients are taken into the cells that line the Gl tract. Metabolism is the sum of the vast
number of chemical changes in the cell that ultimately produce the materials that are essential for energy,
tissue building, and metabolic controls.

p. 58
Question 53

Which body part is a component of the gastrointestinal system? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |] Esophagus
@ |] Stomach

@ [Bm] Small intestine
@ |B) Gall bladder
@ |) Pancreas

[_] Kidneys

That's right!

Rationale

The esophagus, stomach, small intestine, gall bladder, and pancreas are some of the components of the
gastrointestinal system. The kidneys are not a part of the gastrointestinal system, but they play a role in
digestion by filtering nutrient rich blood following absorption in the small intestine.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 59
Question 54

Which type of movement does the smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal (Gl) wall facilitate?
Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Peristalsis

[|_| Swallowing

tx} [ml] Constriction
iv) [ml] Muscle tone

[| Stimulation

So close!

Rationale

The smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal wall controls alternating muscular contractions and relaxations
called peristalsis, which moves the food mass forward in the digestive tract. Muscle tone or tonic contraction is
provided by the smooth muscle, which ensures continuous passage of the food mass and valve control along
the way. Swallowing is facilitated by muscles at the base of the tongue. Constriction is not a type of movement
provided by the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal wall. Stimulation is provided by secretions in various
parts of the digestive system; it is not a smooth muscle movement.

p. 58
Question 55

Which process of digestion is a main task of the large intestine?

@ © Absorption of water
©) Digestion of dietary fiber

© Transporting nutrients to the cells

©) Formation and passage of intestinal gas

That's right!

Rationale

The main task of the large intestine is the absorption of water. Dietary fiber is not digested because specific
enzymes needed to break down molecules in the fiber are lacking. Nutrients are not transported to the cells by
the large intestine. Formation and passage of intestinal gas is a normal process in the large intestine, but it is

not the main task.

p. 67
Question 56

In which way are nutrients transported to various cells throughout the body? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [BB] Fat-soluble nutrients are transported by the lymphatic system.

@ [_| Water-soluble nutrients are absorbed into the circulatory system.

@ [BB] Portal circulation transports nutrients from the intestines to the liver.

@ |B] The circulatory system disperses nutrients to other cells throughout the body.

|_| The lymphatic system provides an alternative route for water-soluble nutrients.

So close!

Rationale

The lymphatic system provides an alternative route for fat-soluble nutrient absorption because fats are not
water soluble. Water-soluble nutrients are absorbed into the vascular system (i.e., the blood circulatory system)
directly from the intestinal cells. The nutrients travel first to the liver for immediate use by the hepatocytes
through portal circulation. After traveling to the liver, the circulatory system disperses remaining nutrients to
other cells throughout the body. The lymphatic system provides an alternative route for fat-soluble, not water-
soluble, nutrients.

p. 68
Question 57

At which point during mechanical digestion in the stomach does the bolus become chyme?
© When the food enters the fundus

iv) © When the food mass reaches the antrum
O As the food mass is released into the duodenum

© After salivary amylase mixes with food

That's right!

Rationale

The bolus is propelled forward from the esophagus through the gastroesophageal sphincter into the stomach;
by the time it reaches the lower portion of the stomach (the antrum), it is a semiliquid acid-food mix called
chyme. The food enters the fundus, the upper part of the stomach, as individual bolus lumps. When the food
mass is released into the duodenum by the pyloric valve, it has already been converted to chyme. Salivary
amylase mixes with food while it is in the mouth so that it can be swallowed in the form of a bolus; this is not
part of mechanical digestion in the stomach.

p. 60
Question 58

Which is a role of pancreatic enzymes during chemical digestion? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

|_| Enterokinase activates trypsinogen, which converts to trypsin.
@ [| Pancreatic amylase converts starch into maltose and sucrose.
@ [BB] Trypsin and chymotrypsin split protein molecules into single amino acids.
@ |B) Pancreatic lipase converts triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids.

|_| Cholecystokinin prompts the release of pancreatic juices and bile to emulsify fat.

So close!

Rationale

Pancreatic amylase aids in the chemical digestion of carbohydrates by converting starch into disaccharides
maltose and sucrose. The chemical digestion of protein begins when the pancreatic enzymes trypsin and
chymotrypsin split large protein molecules into smaller peptide fragments and then into single amino acids.
The chemical digestion of fat occurs when pancreatic lipase converts triglycerides into monoglycerides and
fatty acids. Enterokinase is an intestinal enzyme that activates trypsinogen, which converts to trypsin.
Cholecystokinin is a hormone, not an enzyme.

pp. 61-62
Question 59

In which absorption process in the small intestine does the cell engulf large molecules in

order to absorb them?

iv) © Pinocytosis
O Active transport
© Simple diffusion
© Facilitated diffusion

That's right!

Rationale

Pinocytosis is the engulfing of a large molecule by the cell; materials attach to the cell membrane before the
cell engulfs it. Active transport assists particles to move against their concentration gradient with the help of a
carrier molecule; it does not involve engulfing large molecules. Simple diffusion is the force by which
molecules move from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration, not engulfing
molecules. Facilitated diffusion is a carrier-assisted movement of larger items across the mucosal cell

membrane; it does not involve engulfing large molecules.

p. 66
Question 60

Which genetic disease causes complications for patients despite rigorous treatment?

iv) © Galactosemia

© Celiac disease
© Phenylketonuria

© Glycogen-storage diseases

That's right!

Rationale

Despite rigorous treatment of adhering to a strict galactose-free diet, patients with galactosemia generally
experience complications, such as cognitive disability, speech problems, neurologic and/or movement
disorders, and ovarian dysfunction, at some point in life. Celiac disease is an allergy to the protein gluten and
is not a genetic disorder. Phenylketonuria can cause severe irreversible brain damage and central nervous
system damage if left untreated but can be controlled by a low-phenylalanine diet consisting of a special
supplemental nutrition formula. Glycogen-storage diseases are controlled by dietary treatment to avoid

hypoglycemia.

Question 2

Which form of energy is required for involuntary body functions like brain and nerve

activities?
@ © Electrical energy
© ©@ Chemical energy

© Mechanical energy
© Thermal energy

So close!

Rationale
Electrical energy is required for the involuntary operations that take place in the brain and nerves. Chemical
energy is primarily used in various metabolic processes in the body, not in the brain and nerves. Mechanical

energy is used for actions like muscle contractions. Thermal energy is used to regulate body temperature.

Test-Taking Tip: Because few things in life are absolute without exceptions, avoid selecting answers that

include words such as always, never, all, every, and none. Answers containing these key words are rarely correct.

or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [) Physical activity

© [B) Thyroid function

[|_| Inflammatory markers
@ [| Thermal effects of food

@ [BB] Basal energy expenditure

So close!

Rationale

The TEE comprises the energy needs for basal energy expenditure (BEE), physical activities, and the thermic
effects of food, which may vary between individual patients. Thyroid function and inflammatory markers do
affect the BEE but are not components of the TEE.

p. 75
Question 4

A clinician is measuring the basal energy expenditure of athletes before and after a sporting

event. Which method does the clinician use for a high degree of accuracy?

iv) © Ventilated hood

©) Metabolic chambers
©) Handheld oxygen measuring device

© Oxygen and carbon monoxide measurements

That's right!

Rationale

A portable metabolic cart allows the person to breathe into an attached mouthpiece or ventilated hood system
while lying down, which allows the technician to calculate the metabolic rate with a high degree of accuracy
from the rate of gas exchange. Special metabolic chambers are rare and not widely used. Handheld devices

that measure oxygen or oxygen and carbon monoxide are not proven reliable.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

Question 6

Which statement defines resting energy expenditure (REE)?

© ©@ It is the amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life when a person is at
complete digestive, physical, mental, thermal, and emotional rest.

© It refers to an increase in energy expenditure caused by the activities of digestion, absorption,
transport, and metabolism of ingested food.

@ © Itis the amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life at rest over a 24-
hour period.

© Itis the energy required for work, recreation, and activities of daily living.

So close!

Rationale

REE is the amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life at rest over a 24-hour
period. It is often used interchangeably with the term basal energy expenditure (BEE), but in actuality it is
slightly higher because the protocol for measurement does not put the person at complete rest. BEE is the
amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life when a person is at complete
digestive, physical, mental, thermal, and emotional rest. It is also referred to as the basal metabolic rate. The
increase in energy expenditure caused by the activities of digestion, absorption, transport, and metabolism of
ingested food is the thermic effect of food. The energy required for physical activity involved in work,
recreation, and activities of daily living is not the REE.

on 2 soccer teams with games and practice.

EER = 88.5 - (61.9 x Age [yr]) + PA x (26.7 x Weight [kg]

+ 903 x Height [m]) + 25 kcal

So close!

Rationale

The young male patient should consume at least 3339 kcal/day to maintain his current weight. The EER
formula requires the clinician to convert height to meters. First convert to feet and inches to centimeters (1 in
= 2.54); then convert to meters (100 cm = 1 m) and weight to kg (2.2 lb = 1 kg).

Patient’s height in inches: (4 ft x 12 in/ft) + 4 in = 52 in

Patient’s height in cm: 52 in x 2.54 cm/in = 132.08 cm = 1.3208 m

Patient’s weight in kg: 75 Ib + 2.2 Ib/kg = 34.09 kg

Multiply the patient’s age, weight, and height to the respective numbers in the formula. Add the height and
weight numbers together before multiplying by the PA Coefficient for a highly active individual.

EER = 88.5 - (61.9 x 9) + 1.42 x [(26.7 x 34.09) + (903 x 1.3208)] + 25

Height: 5 feet 10 inchesWeight: 190 poundsModerately active physical activityRecord

answer as a whole number. @} 2725 kcal/day

Patient Data PA Coefficient (PA)
Sex: | Male Highly active: 1.725
Age: | 57 Moderately active: 1.55
Height: | 5 ft 10 in Lightly active: 1.375
Weight: | 190 Ib Sedentary: 1.2
Exercise: | Bikes or swims 3 times a week in addition to
daily 30-minute walks

Harris Benedict formula: TEE (kcal/day) = (66.47 + 5 x Height [cm]
+ 13.75 x Weight [kg] - 6.755 x Age) x PA

That's right!

Rationale

The male patient should consume no more than 2725 kcal/day to maintain his current weight. The TEE
formula requires the clinician to convert height to cm (2.54 cm = 1 in) and weight to kg (2.2 Ib = 1 kg).
Patient’s height in inches: (5 ft x 12 in/ft) +10 in = 70 in

Patient’s height in cm: 70 in x 2.54 cm/in = 177.8 cm

Patient’s weight in kg: 190 Ib x 2.2 Ib/kg = 86.36 kg
Multiply the patient’s height, weight, and age to the respective numbers in the formula before adding height

and weight together and subtract the age total. Then complete the formula by multiplying the total by the PA

(moderately active).
TEE = [66.47 + (5 x 177.8 cm) + (13.75 x 86.36) - (6.755 x 57)] x 1.55 =

and weight together and subtract the age total. Then complete the formula by multiplying the total by the PA
(moderately active).

TEE = [66.47 + (5 x 177.8 cm) + (13.75 x 86.36) - (6.755 x 57)] x 1.55 =

TEE = (66.47 + 889 + 1187.45 - 385.035) x 1.55 =

TEE = 1757.885 x 1.55 = 2724.72 rounded to the nearest whole number = 2725 kcal/day

Question 17

A 6-month infant who weighs 9.3125 pounds has been diagnosed with failure to thrive.

Calculate the estimated energy requirements (EER) for the patient. 9/33 | kcal/day

Patient Data
Age: | 6 months
Height: | 23 inches
Weight: | 9 Ib 5 oz
EER = (89 x Weight [kg] — 100) + 56 kcal

That's right!

Rationale

An infant 6 months of age should consume at least 333 kcal/day. The formula is the same for children under
36 months or 3 years. The EER formula requires the conversion of weight to kg (2.2 Ib = 1 kg); there are 16 oz
to a lb: 5 oz = 0.3125 Ib

Patient’s weight in kg: 9.3125 |b + 2.2 Ib/kg = 4.233 kg

Then complete the formula:

(89 x 4.233) - 100 + 56 = 332.737 rounded to nearest whole number 333 kcal/day

p.77
Question 18

A patient admitted to an inpatient unit was diagnosed with cachexia. Which source of
stored energy is the patient’s body most likely using to maintain central nervous system
function?

© Adipose tissue
ivy) © Protein in muscle mass
© Glycogen stored in the liver

© Glycogen reserve in muscle

That's right!

Rationale

The need for glucose to fuel the central nervous system results in loss of body protein from muscle mass
when energy and carbohydrate intakes are inadequate, especially in the case of cachexia. The supply of adipose
tissue varies from person to person and is not the source of energy this patient’s body would use. Glycogen
reserves in the liver and muscle are depleted quickly and are not the source of stored energy the patient’s body

would use.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no

pattern to the answers.

p. 75
Question 19

When food is not available, such as during sleep, the body draws from its stored energy.
Which stored energy source is responsible for maintaining normal glucose levels during
sleep?

@ @ Glycogen
O Fat storage
© Muscle mass

© Adipose tissue

That's right!

Rationale

Glycogen stores maintain normal blood glucose levels during sleep when food is not available. Fat storage,
muscles mass, and adipose tissue do not maintain blood glucose levels during sleep.

pp. 74-75
Question 20

Most of the kilocalories in fruits come from which food category?

@ ©@ Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale

Most of the kilocalories in fruits come from carbohydrates due to their sugar content. Fruits are not high in
proteins, fats, or alcohol.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 74
Question 21

Which of the following can increase the basal metabolic rate (BMR)?
© Malnutrition

© Age of 85 years

Fever of 101.0°F
0 ®

© High body fat percentage

That's right!

Rationale

Fever increases the BMR. BMR increases 7% for every 1°F rise in body temperature. Malnutrition lowers the
BMR. As humans age, the loss of muscle tissue and to a lesser extent organ tissue lowers their BMR. Body fat
and adipose tissue are less active than lean body mass and lower the BMR.

p. 78
Question 22

A patient is going to have their basal metabolic rate (BMR) measured to help develop a diet

plan to promote a healthy lifestyle. Which condition can prevent the patient from having the
testing done?

O Resting in supine position
© No food intake for 12 hours
@ © Increase in body temperature
© ©@ Inactivity for 1 hour before the test

So close!

Rationale

Normal body temperature is a required condition for measuring BMR; therefore, an increase in body
temperature will most likely prevent the patient from having the test done. Resting in a supine position is
required for measuring BMR. An overnight fast, or no food for 12 to 14 hours, before the test is required for

measuring BMR.A relaxed state with no activity up to 1 hour prior is required for measuring BMR.

p. 78
Question 23

What is the patient’s body mass index (BMI) if they have a weight of 70 kg (154 Ib) and
height of 1.74 m (69 in)?

© 15.4 kg/m ?
20.4 kg/m 2

O g/
22.6 kg/m 2

O g/

@ © 23.1 kg/m?

That's right!

Rationale

The patient’s BMI is 23.1 kg/m 2, which is calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the

height in meters. The patient’s BMI using the height and weight given does not equal 15.4, 20.4, or 22.6 kg/m
2

p. 84
Question 24

Which statement by the patient demonstrates that they understand the concept of a healthy
weight range?
© "I should aim for a body mass index (BMI) of 16 kg/m a"
@ © "should aim for a BMI of 24 kg/m an
© ©@ "should aim for a BMI of 25 kg/m an

© "I should aim for a BMI of 29 kg/m an

So close!

Rationale

The desirable BMI range for adults is 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m *; therefore the patient should aim for a BMI of 24
kg/m 2. A BMI of 16 kg/m 2 indicates the underweight range. A BMI of 25 kg/m is associated with health
risks associated with being overweight. A BMI of 29 kg/m also indicates being overweight.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 83
Question 25

Which method is used for estimating dietary energy intake? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B] Using food labels to gather nutrient information of foods consumed throughout the day
|_| Eating foods prescribed by a dietician
@ |B] Using various databases to look up the energy value of foods eaten

@ [BB] Using online or mobile apps that allow the user to enter portions of food consumed to calculate total
daily intake

|_| Taking body weight before and after a meal

That's right!

Rationale

Methods used for estimating dietary energy intake include using food labels to gather nutrient information of
foods consumed throughout the day, using various databases to look up the energy value of foods eaten, or by
using online or mobile apps that allow the user to enter portions of food consumed to calculate total daily
intake. Dietary energy intake is not estimated by eating foods prescribed by a dietician or by taking body
weight before and after a meal.

p. 74
Question 26

Which step helps maintain energy balance in the body?

© Ensure that the food energy intake consistently exceeds body energy output.

© Ensure that the body energy output consistently exceeds food energy input.
© Reduce the thermic effect of food.

@ ©@ Ensure that the food energy intake matches body energy output as an average over time.

That's right!

Rationale

To maintain energy balance, food energy intake must match body energy output as an average over time.
Energy intake that exceeds body energy output will lead to energy imbalance and possible weight gain. Body
energy output that exceeds food energy input also leads to energy imbalance and possible extreme and
unhealthy weight loss. Thermic energy is the extra energy required by the body for physical processes related
to digestion, absorption, and transportation of nutrients. Reduction of this energy will not maintain energy
balance in the body.

p. 79
Question 27

Which major factor influences basal energy expenditure (BEE)? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Growth periods
ivy) [ml] Disease state
ivy) [| Hormonal status

So close!

Rationale

Major factors that affect BEE are body composition, growth periods, body temperature, hormonal status, and
disease state. BEE is defined as the amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life

when a person is at complete digestive, physical, mental, thermal, and emotional rest.

pp. 77-78
Question 28

Which term refers to the amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the
maintenance of life when a person is at complete digestive, physical, mental, thermal, and
emotional rest?

@ © Basal energy expenditure (BEE)
© Thermic effect of food

© © Resting energy expenditure (REE)
© Total energy expenditure (TEE)

So close!

Rationale

BEE is the amount of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life when a person is at
complete digestive, physical, mental, thermal, and emotional rest. It is also referred to as the basal metabolic
rate. It is expressed in kilocalories per day. The increase in energy expenditure caused by the activities of
digestion, absorption, transport, and metabolism of ingested food is the thermic effect of food. The amount
of energy (in kcal) needed by the body for the maintenance of life at rest over a 24-hour period is the REE. It is
often used interchangeably with the term basal energy expenditure, but in actuality it is slightly higher because
the protocol for measurement does not put the person at complete rest. TEE of an individual is the sum of the
BEE, energy needs for physical activities, and the thermic effect of food.

p. 75
Question 29

Which process belongs to the external energy cycle? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

@ |B] Transformation of the sun’s radiation into stored energy by plants
@ |B] Consumption of plants by animals

|_| Breaking down of polysaccharide in the human body

@ [BB] Radiation of heat energy by the sun
|__| Production of fatty acids in the human body

That's right!

Rationale

The external energy cycle includes the radiation of heat by the ultimate source of energy, the sun. The
transformation of the sun’s energy into stored energy by plants is also part of the external energy cycle. The
intake of plants by different animals, or the food chain, is also part of the external energy cycle. These occur
outside of the human body. Breaking down of polysaccharides in the human body is part of the internal
energy cycle. Production of fatty acids in the human body is also part of the internal energy cycle.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 74
Question 30

When referring to body energy, which statement is associated to energy unit
measurements?

@ ©@ Kilojoules are commonly used on food labels.
© Joules are region-specific energy measurements.
© Kilocalorie and calorie are interchangeable terms.

O Calorie is the term most often used in scientific literature.

That's right!

Rationale

Nutrition facts labels on food products in most of the world express energy in units of kilojoules. Joules are an
international energy measurement unit. There is a difference between a calorie and a kilocalorie, and the
terms are not interchangeable. Kilocalorie is the term that is used in scientific literature.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 73
Question 31

A patient in the clinic has symptoms including weight gain and fatigue. Which factor does
the nurse consider when assessing this patient?

O Age
tx} © Sex

O Tissue mass

ivy) O Hormone levels

So close!

Rationale

Thyroids hormones play a significant role in regulating metabolism. Thyroid function tests can measure the
activity of the thyroid gland because patients with an underactive thyroid gland may develop hypothyroidism,
a decreased metabolic rate, that can cause weight gain and fatigue. Age, sex, and tissue mass are not

associated with the body’s energy needs.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

p. 78
Question 32

Which concern requires the nurse to pursue further inquiry about lifestyle changes when
discussing recent decreased basal energy expenditure (BEE) results with a teen athlete?

iv) O Anorexia nervosa

© ©@ Recent weight gain
© Weight-lifting program

©) Use of growth hormones

So close!

Rationale
States of starvation and malnutrition can cause adaptive thermogenesis, which results in lowered heat
production to conserve energy and BEE decreases. Weight gain, weight-lifting—which increases lean muscle

mass—and using growth hormones for performance enhancement would increase BEE.

p. 78
Question 33

Which information does the nurse obtain when assessing the anthropometrics of a patient?

© Kilocalories (kcals) used by the resting body
iv) © Body composition measurements

© Energy expenditure of metabolism
© Heat produced by the body at work

That's right!

Rationale

Anthropometric measurements include the physical measurements of the human body including height,
weight, and body composition. Kcals used by the resting body are the resting energy expenditure (REE);
energy expenditure of metabolism is the thermic effect of food; heat produced by the body at work is
measured as calories.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) Determine what the question is
really asking and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly and see if it completely covers the
material asked by the question; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 75
Question 34

Which dietary item would the nurse explain to a patient to include in the first meal of the

day to replenish the glucose levels?

O Sucrose

O Soluble fat

O Lean protein

@ ©@ Carbohydrates

That's right!

Rationale

Normal blood glucose levels needed for daily energy needs deplete during sleep. The liver and muscle have a
12- to 48-hour reserve of glycogen, but the body will quickly use this supply overnight, and it must be
replenished through daily carbohydrate intake, especially at breakfast. Sucrose (which is a form of sugar), fats,

and proteins do not restore the glycogen supplies to meet the energy needs of the body.

p. 75
Question 35

When advising about types of diet, which information would be included as a specific
concern for a young teenage patient?

© Glycogen stores are replenished with proteins.
O Donuts are a source of energy dense nutrients.
@ © Lean tissue is used during long periods of fasting.

© @ Muscle mass is the main energy source in the body.

So close!

Rationale

Lean tissue serves important structural functions and is sacrificed for energy use during longer periods of
fasting or starvation, which can cause weakness and other difficulties. Glycogen is replenished with

carbohydrates. Donuts are a source of empty calories. Muscle mass is not the main energy source in the body.

p. 75
Question 36

Which area of the body provides unlimited fat storage for the body to use as energy?
O Active organs

@ ©@ Adipose tissue

© Glycogen stores
©) Skeletal muscles

That's right!

Rationale

There is a relatively unlimited amount of energy that one can store in adipose tissue. Active organs and
skeletal muscles do not store much energy; rather, they expend energy. The body quickly depletes the
glycogen supply, which must be renewed daily with carbohydrate intake.

p. 75
Question 37

During which stage of life do women store more fat?

iv) © Pregnancy

O Postpartum

© Prepuberty
O Premenopause

That's right!

Rationale

Women store more fat during pregnancy. Women do not store more fat during the postpartum, prepuberty,
or premenopause stages of life.

p.77
Question 38

When using body mass index (BMI), which group may be considered overweight but not
“overfat"?

tx} © Children

O Obese adults

@ © Phisically active adults

© Individuals with below-average height

So close!

Rationale

When both weight and fat are measured the same for men and women, there are usually some individuals
who are overweight but not "overfat." This group is most likely to include physically active adults. This is not
necessarily true of children, obese adults, or individuals with below-average height.

p. 83
Question 39

Basal metabolic rate, physical activity, and lean muscle mass are included in which category

of risk factors for obesity?

© Genetic

@ © Phisiologic
O Psychological
© Environmental

That's right!

Rationale

Physiologic risk factors for obesity include basal metabolic rate, physical activity, and lean muscle mass.
Genetic risk factors include a predisposition to obesity associated with genetics. Psychological risk factors
include work, family, and social environments that cultivate stress, which many people respond to by eating
for comfort. Environmental risk factors include an increase in energy-dense food availability and low-cost fast

and convenient foods.

p. 83
Question 40

When fasting, the body accesses glycogen stores from which part of the body for short-term

energy needs?
© Brain
@ © Liver
© Kidneys

O Pancreas

That's right!

Rationale

Glycogen stored in the liver is a source of energy that the body can use for short-term needs. The brain,

kidneys, and pancreas do not store glycogen for energy.

p. 75
Question 41

Which patient has the highest basal metabolic rate (BMR)?
© @ 56-year-old female patient with a fever

© 60-year-old male patient without a fever
@ © 47-year-old male patient with renal disease

© 48-year-old female patient with renal disease

So close!

Rationale

The 47-year-old male patient is likely to have the highest BMR because men have a higher BMR than women,
and renal disease increases the metabolic work of the body and therefore the BMR. The 56-year-old female
patient is likely to have a lower BMR because women have less muscle and more fat, resulting in a lower BMR.
The 60-year-old male patient has a lower BMR because he is afebrile. The 48-year-old female patient with
renal disease has a lower BMR because women have less muscle and more fat, resulting in a lower BMR, even
though she has renal disease.

p. 75
Question 42

Which thermal regulation changes would the nurse explain to a patient entering
menopause?

© Increase in fat-free body mass
© Decrease in body fat mass

ivy) © Decrease in metabolic rate

© Increase the caloric density of food

That's right!

Rationale

A decline in the metabolic rate occurs in menopausal women. There is an accompanying increase, not
decrease, in body fat mass and a loss, not increase, of fat-free mass that accompanies menopause in women.
Emphasis should be increasing nutrient-dense foods and decreasing caloric-dense foods.

p. 83
Question 43

For which difference does the nurse adjust the resting metabolic rate (RMR) formula? Select

all that apply.One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B) Sex
[| Weight
|_| Body type
|_| Type of diet
|_| Activity level

That's right!

Rationale

Studies examined sex differences in resting metabolic rate (RMR) or resting energy expenditure (REE)_and
results support a lower RMR in women than in men that is independent of differences in weight, body type,
diet, and activity level. A different formula is used to determine the RMR for women.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only

some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 44
ee

Calculate the total energy expenditure (TEE) using the Harris Benedict formula based on

the information below:

MaleAge: 57

Height: 5 feet 10 inchesWeight: 190 poundsModerately active physical activityRecord

answer as a whole number. @} 2725 kcal/day

Patient Data PA Coefficient (PA)
Sex: | Male Highly active: 1.725
Age: | 57 Moderately active: 1.55
Height: | 5 ft 10 in Lightly active: 1.375
Weight: | 190 Ib Sedentary: 1.2
Exercise: | Bikes or swims 3 times a week in addition to
daily 30-minute walks

Harris Benedict formula: TEE (kcal/day) = (66.47 + 5 x Height [cm]
+ 13.75 x Weight [kg] - 6.755 x Age) x PA

That's right!

Rationale

The male patient should consume no more than 2725 kcal/day to maintain his current weight. The TEE
formula requires the clinician to convert height to cm (2.54 cm = 1 in) and weight to kg (2.2 Ib = 1 kg).
Patient’s height in inches: (5 ft x 12 in/ft) +10 in = 70 in

Patient’s height in cm: 70 in x 2.54 cm/in = 177.8 cm

Patient’s weight in kg: 190 Ib x 2.2 Ib/kg = 86.36 kg

Multiply the patient’s height, weight, and age to the respective numbers in the formula before adding height
and weight together and subtract the age total. Then complete the formula by multiplying the total by the PA

(moderately active).
TEE = [66.47 + (5 x 177.8 cm) + (13.75 x 86.36) - (6.755 x 57)] x 1.55 =

Question 1

Which statement will the nurse make when teaching a patient about adequate intake of
fruits and vegetables?

@ ©@ ‘Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables each time you eat."
© "You should have a minimum of eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day."
© "Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables."

© "Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) dietary recommendations."

That's right!

Rationale

The best statement a nurse can make when teaching a patient about adequate intake of fruits and vegetables
is "Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables each time you eat." This provides a visual measure of how
many fruits and vegetables should be on the patient’s plate each time the patient eats. Recommending a
minimum of eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day for a patient is excessive. Telling the patient to
increase the intake of fruit and vegetables is vague and does not provide guidelines for the patient to follow.
Telling a patient to follow the CDC’s dietary recommendations is less helpful because it is not guaranteed that
the patient can access or understand the information.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 108
Question 2

Fruits and vegetables of which color are the best source of the phytochemical anthocyanin?

© Yellow-green
© White-green

O Orange
@ @ Red-purple

That's right!

Rationale

Red-purple fruits and vegetables are the best source of the phytochemical anthocyanin. Yellow-green produce
provides zeaxanthin. White-green produce contains allyl sulfides. Orange produce provides beta-carotene.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

Question 3

Which carotenoid cannot be converted into vitamin A? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

[| Beta carotene

iv) [ml] Lycopene
iv) [| Lutein
iv) [| Zeaxanthin

|_| Allyl sulfide

So close!

Rationale

Lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin are carotenoids that cannot be converted into vitamin A. Beta carotene is a
provitamin A carotenoid that can be converted by the body to retinol, which is a form of vitamin A. Allyl sulfide
is an organic compound that contains sulfur but is not a carotenoid. It is found in white-green foods and can
be converted into vitamin A.

p. 88
Question 4

Which food source provides the most phytonutrients?

That's right!

Rationale

Legumes are the greatest source of phytonutrients. Dairy, meat, and other foods that are derived from
animals and foods that have been processed and refined are virtually devoid of phytochemicals. However,

certain vegetable oils such as olive oil are a source of phytonutrients.

p. 108
Question 5

Which food is considered "nutrient empty"?

That's right!

Rationale
Refined grains are considered a "nutrient-empty" food. Dairy products, oils, and fruits are rich in nutrients and

are parts of the food groups necessary for functional health.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

Question 6

Which carotenoid found in yellow-green foods is specifically associated with the prevention
of age-related macular degeneration?

© Anthocyanin

O Glucosinolate

@ © Zeaxanthin
tx} © Lycopene

So close!

Rationale

Zeaxanthin is the carotenoid found in yellow-green foods that is associated with the prevention of age-related
macular degeneration. Anthocyanin, which is found in red-purple foods, is a flavonoid. Glucosinolate is a
nutrient found in green foods. Lycopene is a red carotene that is a powerful antioxidant.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

Question 7

Which action do phytonutrients display that aid in cancer prevention?
iv) © Promote antioxidant activity

© Impair RNA synthesis

O Increase immune response

© Improve cell signaling

That's right!

Rationale

Phytonutrients promote antioxidant activity, which works to protect the body from damage caused by free
radicals. Free radicals lead to oxidative stress, which is associated with an increased risk for cancer.
Phytonutrients impair DNA synthesis, not RNA synthesis. Vitamin A is required to help keep the body’s
immune response healthy. Vitamin E is responsible for improving cell signaling, specifically to drive gene
expression and antiproliferative effects in the eye that appear to be protective against conditions such as
glaucoma.

pp. 107-108
Question 8

Which characteristic of vitamin D is accurate?

© The only source is sunlight.
© The vitamin is required to maintain cell membranes.
@ ©@ It is measured in international units.

© Recommended daily amounts are combined with vitamin K.

That's right!

Rationale

Recommended daily doses of vitamin D are measured in international units. Although sunlight provides
vitamin D, a patient can also get it through dietary intake. Vitamin D does not play a role in maintaining cell
membranes. Vitamin K is produced in the intestine and does not need to be combined with vitamin D.

p.92
Question 9

Which system is sensitive to a vitamin D deficiency?

O Ocular

O Gastrointestinal

ivy) © Musculoskeletal

O Integumentary

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin D deficiencies may cause rickets or osteomalacia, which are musculoskeletal disorders. Vitamin D

deficiencies do not generally cause issues with the ocular, gastrointestinal, or integumentary systems.

p.91
Question 10

Which B vitamin deficiency puts a patient at risk for Beriberi?
O B 2 (riboflavin)
O Be (pyridoxine)

@ © Bi (thiamin)
© B3(niacin)

That's right!

Rationale

Beriberi is a disease of the peripheral nerves caused by a deficiency of vitamin B }. It is characterized by
neuritis, paralysis of the legs and arms, cardiovascular changes, and edema. Vitamin B 2 deficiency places a
patient at risk for cracked lips and mouth corners; a swollen, red tongue; burning, itching, or tearing eyes
caused by extra blood vessels in the cornea; and a scaly, greasy dermatitis in the skin folds. Vitamin B 6
deficiency can cause abnormal central nervous system function with hyperirritability, neuritis, possible
convulsions, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. A deficiency in vitamin B 3 results in weakness, poor

appetite, indigestion, and various disorders of the skin and nervous system.

p. 98
Question 11

Which food is the best source of B vitamins?

That's right!

Rationale

Meats provide the greatest source of B vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, and
cobalamin. Fruits and dairy are not strong sources of B vitamins. Legumes contain thiamin and pyridoxine

but not the others that meat can provide.

p. 106
Question 12

Which diet puts a person at the highest risk for vitamin B j2 (cobalamin) deficiency?

iv) © Vegan

O Pescatarian

O Lacto-vegetarian

O Vegetarian

That's right!

Rationale

A vegan diet places a person at risk for cobalamin deficiency. Vegans do not eat dairy products, eggs, or any
other products derived from animals, which are the only natural sources of cobalamin, so vegans must rely on
dietary supplements or fortified foods to meet their daily requirements. A pescatarian diet includes fish, which
is a good source of vitamin B 12. Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy products. Vegetarians may consume dairy
products and eggs.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 104
Question 13

Which statement describes the function of vitamin D?

@ ©@ Promotes calcium absorption
© |s responsible for wound healing
O Has antioxidant properties

© Plays a role in blood clotting

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin D facilitates intestinal absorption of calcium. Vitamin A facilitates wound healing. Vitamin E acts as an
antioxidant, and vitamin K plays a role in blood-clotting factors.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

Question 14

Which amount of riboflavin should be taken daily by females?
© 1.5 mg/day with a maximum amount of 100 mg

@ © 1.1 mg/day with no set maximum amount
© @ 1:3 mg/day with no set maximum amount

© 10 mg/day with a maximum amount of 35 mg/day

So close!

Rationale

The recommended supplementation for riboflavin for women is 1.1 mg/day, and there is no set upper limit.
The dose 1.5 mg is more than necessary, and 100 mg is not the maximum. The recommended dosage of
riboflavin for men is 1.3 mg/day. The amount 10 mg/day is much more than necessary.

p. 106
Question 15

Which amount of vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) is recommended as part of a vegan diet?
O 24¢

tx} © 2.4 mg
O 2.4 units

ivy) O 2.4 mcg

So close!

Rationale

The recommended supplementation of cobalamin for a patient on a vegan diet is 2.4 mcg. Measurements in
grams and milligrams are too high of a dosage. The measurement of units is not used for dosing cobalamin.

p. 104
Question 16

Which food is a significant source of both vitamin C and lycopene? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

|_| Eggplant

iv) [ml] Tomatoes

[| Cauliflower

@ [| Pink grapefruit
@ |] Red peppers

So close!

Rationale

Tomatoes, pink grapefruit, and red peppers are high in both vitamin C and lycopene. Eggplant is high in
some of the B vitamins. Cauliflower is high in vitamin C but not lycopene.

pp. 106, 108
Question 17

Which statement describes the function of phytonutrients?

@ ©@ Phytonutrients are bioactive molecules.
© Phytonutrients are unnecessary in disease prevention and optimal wellness.
© Phytonutrients are essential nutrients.

©) Phytonutrients are unprocessed foods.

That's right!

Rationale

Phytonutrients are bioactive molecules found in plants and have multifaceted health benefits. They are not
necessary for sustaining life, but they serve a role in disease prevention and promotion of optimal wellness.
Phytonutrients are not essential nutrients, which are nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body but are
required by the body for normal functioning. Phytonutrients are found in unprocessed foods, but they are not
themselves unprocessed foods.

p. 107
Question 18

Which role does vitamin C (ascorbic acid) play in preventing iron-deficiency anemia?

© Metabolizes folate
© Maintains blood-clotting factors

@ ©@ Helps absorb nonheme iron

© Converts dopamine to norepinephrine

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin C prevents iron-deficiency anemia by helping the body absorb nonheme iron, keeping it in its
bioactive reduced ferrous form. The vitamin is then made available for hemoglobin production, helping to
prevent iron-deficiency anemia. Vitamin C does assist in the metabolism of folate, but folate plays a role in
DNA synthesis and cell division, not preventing anemia. Vitamin K is essential in maintaining the normal
blood concentrations of four clotting factors. Vitamin C is needed to help convert dopamine into
norepinephrine, which are both neurotransmitters.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 96
Question 19

Which coenzyme function does vitamin B ¢ (pyridoxine) have?

O DNA repair
O Cell division

ivy) © Amino acid metabolism

O Macronutrient metabolism

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin Bg functions as a coenzyme in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B 3 (niacin) functions in DNA repair.
Folate (folic acid) participates in cell division. Vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) functions in macronutrient metabolism.

p. 102
Question 20

What is the upper intake level (UL) of retinol for adults established by the Dietary Reference
Intake committee?

© 100 mg/day

© 600 IU/day

© 2000 mg/day
@ @ 3000 meg/day

That's right!

Rationale

The UL of retinol for adults has been set at 3000 mcg/day. The UL for pyridoxine for adults is 100 mg/day
because high doses have been linked to nerve damage. The current UL for calciferol is 600 IU/day for most
adults. The UL for ascorbic acid is 2000 mg/day.

p. 89
Question 21

oes tne DO rely on tne Trequent Intake OT TOOdS ricn In water-soluble VitaMInNs:
Why does the body rely on the frequent intake of foods rich in water-soluble vitamins?
© They are easily oxidized.

© They are easily absorbed by intestinal cells.
@ @ The body does not store water-soluble vitamins.

© Areserve supply is necessary to meet bodily needs.

That's right!

Rationale

The body does not store water-soluble vitamins to any significant extent, so they must be continually replaced.
The oxidation of water-soluble vitamins occurs during food storage and preparation but is not the explanation
for the need for their frequent intake. Both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins are absorbed by intestinal

cells and enter the bloodstream. Because water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body, a reserve supply is
not possible.

p. 87
Question 22

Why it is important to ask a patient about the use of dietary supplements?
© Vitamin needs fluctuate with age.

iv) © Drug-nutrient interactions are common.
©) Dietary supplements can help prevent chronic disease.

© Megadoses of vitamins can cause nutrient deficiencies.

That's right!

Rationale

Drug-nutrient interactions are more common with dietary supplements than with whole foods and may be
detrimental to patients taking certain medications. Changes that occur during the life cycle may cause vitamin
needs to fluctuate, but these changes would not be an immediate cause for concern. Evidence does not
support the use of dietary supplements to prevent chronic disease. Megadoses of vitamins can cause toxic
side effects but do not contribute to nutrient deficiencies.

pp. 109-110
Question 23

Which function is associated with vitamin K?

@ ©@ Blood clotting

O Immune function
O Antioxidant action

O Neuromuscular function

That's right!

Rationale

Blood clotting and bone development are functions associated with vitamin K. Immune response is a
function associated with several vitamins, including vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin E.
Antioxidant action in tissues is a vital function associated with vitamin E. Neuromuscular function is one of

the many processes associated with vitamin D.

p. 93
Question 24

When taken in excessive amounts for a prolonged period, which vitamin causes
hypercalcemia?

O Vitamin K

O Vitamin E

O Vitamin A

ivy) © Vitamin D

That's right!

Rationale

Prolonged excessive intake of vitamin D may produce elevated blood calcium concentrations (i.e.,
hypercalcemia). Toxicity of vitamin K is rare and does not cause hypercalcemia. Vitamin E has no known toxic
effects. Hypervitaminosis A causes many symptoms, including bone pain, dry skin, fatigue, anorexia, and loss

of hair, but does not cause hypercalcemia.

p.92
Question 25

Which of the following is a fat-soluble vitamin?

ivy) © Vitamin D

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin because it dissolves in fatty tissues and substances. Other fat-soluble
vitamins include vitamins A, E, and K. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve or disperse in water; thiamin, folate,

and niacin are water-soluble.

p. 87
Question 26

Which food is a source of vitamin A? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may
be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

iv) [| Liver
iv) [ml] Carrots

© |B] Salmon
iv) [ml] Sweet potato

So close!

Rationale

Liver, carrots, and sweet potato are sources of vitamin A. Yogurt is a source of riboflavin, and salmon is a
source of B-complex vitamins.

p. 89
Question 27

Which best describes the function of vitamin A?

© Facilitates intestinal absorption of calcium
iv) © Maintains skin and the inner mucous membranes
O Acts as an antioxidant in cell membranes

© Synthesizes blood clotting factors

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin A maintains skin and the inner mucous membranes. Vitamin D facilitates intestinal absorption of
calcium. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant in cell membranes. Vitamin K synthesizes blood-clotting factors.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your

knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 88
Question 28

Which of the following best describes the function of vitamin E?

© Facilitates intestinal absorption of calcium
O Maintains skin and mucous membranes
ivy) © Acts as an antioxidant in cell membranes

© Synthesizes blood-clotting factors

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant in cell membranes. Vitamin D facilitates intestinal absorption of calcium.
Vitamin A maintains skin and mucous membranes. Vitamin K synthesizes blood-clotting factors.

p.92
Question 29

Which statement best explains how primary deficiency of a vitamin occurs?

© Primary deficiency occurs only when a person is experiencing illness.
©) Primary deficiency occurs when the absorption of the vitamin is impaired.
©) Primary deficiency occurs when two vitamins are competing for binding sites.

@ ©@ Primary deficiency occurs when the vitamin is not consumed in sufficient amounts.

That's right!

Rationale

Primary deficiency of a nutrient results from inadequate dietary intake. A secondary deficiency is caused by
malabsorption. Illness can occur as a result of vitamin deficiency, but it doesn’t occur as a result of the illness.
Each vitamin performs a specific metabolic function, so they do not compete for binding sites.

p. 96
Question 30

A new parent asks why the nurse is administering vitamin K to the newborn. What is the
nurse’s best response?

© Newborns are unable to produce vitamin K, and it is important for bone metabolism.
@ @ Newborns are unable to produce vitamin K, which can help prevent hemorrhaging.
© Newborns are unable to produce vitamin K, which facilitates absorption of calcium.

© Newborns are unable to produce vitamin K, which promotes immunity.

That's right!

Rationale

Infants do not have adequate vitamin K stores at birth because vitamin K does not efficiently transfer through
the placenta during gestation, and the intestinal tract of a newborn does not yet have vitamin K—-producing

gut flora. Consequently, infants routinely receive vitamin K injections at birth to prevent hemorrhaging.

p. 96
Question 31

Which B-complex vitamin is an essential constituent of the body’s main activating agent,

coenzyme A?

© Folate
© Choline
© Biotin
@ ©@ Pantothenic acid

That's right!

Rationale

Pantothenic acid is an essential constituent of the body’s main activating agent coenzyme A. Folate is
important for DNA synthesis and cell division. Choline is important for maintaining the structural integrity of
cell membranes. It is also involved in lipid transport, homocysteine reduction, and the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. Biotin is a coenzyme for five carboxylase enzymes, which transfer carbon dioxide moieties from

one molecule to another.

Test-Taking Tip: If you can eliminate any responses as incorrect based on your knowledge, you will not be

guessing randomly but will be exercising "informed guessing.’

p. 105
Question 32

A nurse is providing nutritional counseling for a male patient with no significant medical
history who smokes approximately half a pack of cigarettes per day. What is the

recommended daily intake of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for this patient?

@[ 100 | 125 | malday

So close!

Rationale

The recommended daily of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for men is 90 mg/day and for women is 75 mg/day.
Smokers need an additional 35 mg/day.

p. 106
Question 33

Which sign indicates that a patient that is experiencing vitamin D toxicity? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

[_] Blistered skin
@ [B) Hypercalcemia
|_| Polyphagia
@ [B) Hypercalciuria

[| Eye dryness

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin D toxicity can lead to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Blistered skin is a symptom of vitamin A
toxicity. Polyphagia is a symptom of diabetes, and eye dryness is a symptom of vitamin A deficiency.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p.92
Question 34

Which food source has high amounts of vitamin C (ascorbic acid)? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [B] Tomato juice
@ [B) Peppers
|] Spinach
@ [| Broccoli
© |B] Sweet potatoes

So close!

Rationale

Food sources high in vitamin C include tomato juice, peppers, and broccoli. Spinach and sweet potatoes are

excellent sources of vitamin A, which the body converts to retinol.

p. 98
Question 35

Which toxicity symptoms might occur with an intake of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) greater
than 2000 mg/day?

© Liver damage
O Scurvy

@ ©@ Gastrointestinal disturbance
O Tissue bleeding

That's right!

Rationale

Toxicity symptoms that may be present in a patient with an intake of vitamin C greater than 2000 mg/day
include gastrointestinal disturbance. Liver damage is caused by vitamin A toxicity. Scurvy and tissue bleeding
are a result of a vitamin C deficiency, not toxicity.

p. 98
Question 36

Which food prevents anemia in pregnant and lactating women and promotes the healthy
development of a fetus? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [Bm] Legumes

© [my Fish

© |B] Stone fruits

@ [| Orange juice

@ [| Green, leafy vegetables

So close!

Rationale

Folate helps prevent anemia in pregnant and lactating women and prevents neural tube defects in fetuses.
Foods high in folate include legumes, orange juice, and green, leafy vegetables. Pregnant women should limit
fish, which has high levels of mercury. Stone fruits are healthy but do not necessarily add folate to the diet.

p. 103
Question 37

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is necessary for which critical body function? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

iv) [| Antioxidant function
[_] DNA synthesis

@ [B] Collagen synthesis
@ [_| General body metabolism

© |B] Tissue strength

So close!

Rationale

Vitamin C is necessary for critical body functions such as antioxidant function, collagen synthesis, and general
body metabolism. Vitamin B 17 (cobalamin) is necessary for DNA synthesis, and vitamin A promotes tissue
strength by maintaining healthy epithelial tissue.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 96
Question 38

Deficiency of which vitamin can cause symptoms of constipation, poor appetite, fatigue,
and malaise?

iv) O Thiamin
O Vitamin C
O Riboflavin

tx} © Niacin

So close!

Rationale

Expected physical findings in a patient with a thiamin deficiency include constipation, poor appetite, fatigue,
and malaise caused by lower energy levels. Vitamin C deficiency can result in easy bruising and bleeding, soft
gums, and poor wound healing. Riboflavin deficiency manifests as cracked lips, swollen tongue, and burning,
itchy eyes. Although niacin deficiency can cause poor appetite and indigestion, it is not associated with fatigue

and low energy.

p. 98
Question 39

Which food can a vegetarian consume to increase riboflavin in the diet? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [| Milk

© |B] Oranges

@ [_| Soybeans

@ |B] Enriched cereal

|_| Green, leafy vegetables

So close!

Rationale

Meat and poultry are good sources of riboflavin, but because the patient is a vegetarian, the nurse can
recommend milk, soybeans, and enriched cereal. Oranges are a good source of vitamin C, and green, leafy
vegetables are a good source of folate, but neither is high in riboflavin.

p. 93
Question 40

Which statement is most accurate regarding vitamins?

© All vitamins are synthesized in the human body.
@ @ Most vitamins are provided through dietary intake.
© Vitamins are not essential to metabolic function.

© Vitamins do not affect spiritual or emotional health.

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamins are obtained through dietary intake, with the exception of vitamin D, which is made inside the
human body and can be absorbed from sunlight. Vitamin D is the only vitamin synthesized in the body.
Vitamins are vital to metabolism and can affect physical as well as spiritual and emotional health.

Test-Taking Tip: Identify option components as correct or incorrect. This may help you identify a wrong

answer.

p. 87
Question 41

Which statement made by the nurse is the most appropriate when providing education for
a patient taking high-dose niacin (vitamin B 3) supplements to improve blood lipid profiles?

@ ©@ “Your liver enzymes must be monitored."
© "Flushing of the skin is normal."
© "Avoid the sunlight because it may cause dark, scaly dermatitis."

© "You should continue to take your statin medication for your cardiovascular disease."

That's right!

Rationale

The most appropriate statement by the nurse who is providing education for a patient taking high-dose niacin
supplements to improve blood lipid profiles is, "Your liver enzymes must be monitored." Liver enzymes need
to be periodically checked because of the potential for liver damage from long-term use of high doses of
niacin. Flushing of the skin is an adverse, not normal, effect of high-dose niacin. A patient with a niacin
deficiency should avoid the sunlight because exposed skin may develop dark, scaly dermatitis. A patient with
cardiovascular disease who takes statin medication does not benefit further from supplemental niacin so it is

not recommended.

Test-Taking Tip: Sometimes the reading of a question in the middle or toward the end of an exam may trigger

your mind with the answer or provide an important clue to an earlier question.

p. 101
Question 42

Which amount in micrograms (mcg) represents the daily recommended intake of biotin?

© 400

© 2.4
@G @ 30

O5

That's right!

Rationale

The daily recommended intake of biotin is 30 mcg/day. The daily recommended intake of folate is 400 mcg.
The amount 2.4 mcg is the daily recommended intake of cobalamin. A recommended dosage of 5 mcg is too
low for biotin.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 106
Question 43

Pellagra is managed with therapeutic doses of which vitamin?
iv) © Niacin

© Thiamin

O Vitamin C

© Spina bifida

That's right!

Rationale

Pellagra results from niacin deficiency, so administration of niacin will be included in this patient’s care plan.
Thiamin deficiency causes beriberi. Vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy. Folate administration in pregnant

women can reduce the risk for spina bifida in babies.

p. 100
Question 44

Which individual will have the highest intake of phytonutrients?
© ©@ A person who maintains a vegetarian diet

© A person who takes dietary supplements
@ © Aperson who eats whole grains for breakfast daily

© A person who follows the established daily recommended intake (DRI) for phytonutrients

So close!

Rationale

A patient who eats whole grains daily for breakfast will have the highest intake of phytonutrients. Whole grains
such as oatmeal are an excellent source of these. Following a vegetarian diet does not ensure adequate intake
of phytonutrients. Dietary supplements contain only a few known phytonutrients; taking them does not have

the same advantageous effects as consuming them in whole food forms. There is no established DRI for
phytonutrients.

p. 107
Question 45

Which food contains the phytochemical flavonoid? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Oregano

@ [B) Onions

@ |B) Black tea

@ [| Purple grapes

[| Tomatoes

So close!

Rationale

Significant sources of flavonoid include oregano, onions, black tea, and purple grapes. Tomatoes have a
greater amount of the phytochemical lycopene.

p. 108
Question 46

The nurse is caring for a patient who is receiving long-term parenteral nutrition without

choline. For which disease is this patient at risk?

@ @ Fatty liver disease

O Pernicious anemia

© Xerophthalmia

© Megaloblastic anemia

That's right!

Rationale
Fatty liver disease is associated with long-term parenteral nutrition devoid of choline. Pernicious anemia

occurs in patients with cobalamin (vitamin B 12) deficiency. Xerophthalmia occurs as a result of a vitamin A

deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia results from folate deficiency.

p. 107
Question 47

Which snack food is the best source of phytonutrients?

iv) O Nuts
O Pretzels
tx} © Oatmeal cookies

O Wheat crackers

So close!

Rationale
Nuts are an excellent source of phytonutrients. Pretzels are a refined food that does not contain

phytonutrients. Oatmeal cookies are also a processed food containing sugar and fats, making them a poor
choice for phytonutrients. Wheat crackers do not necessarily contain whole grains, meaning this processed

food could contain no phytonutrients.

p. 107
Question 48

Which food does the nurse recommend to the patient as a good source of vitamin E? Select
all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [_] Spinach
iv) [ml] Sunflower oil
[| Yogurt

[| Chicken

iv) [ml] Hazelnuts

So close!

Rationale

Good sources of vitamin E include green, leafy vegetables like spinach; vegetable oils like sunflower oil; and
nuts like hazelnuts. Yogurt is a good source of riboflavin, and chicken is a good source of B vitamins.

p. 93
Question 49

For which reason is it better to obtain phytonutrients from foods rather than dietary
supplements? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

|_| Phytonutrients are better absorbed from foods.

|_| Phytonutrients are contained only in macronutrients.

|_| Phytonutrients are found in abundance in all foods.

@ [B] Phytonutrients from foods act synergistically to produce health benefits.

That's right!

Rationale

Dietary supplements contain only certain phytonutrients, while specific foods are thought to contain
thousands of phytonutrients that have yet to be identified. It is also better to obtain phytonutrients from foods
rather than dietary supplements because the beneficial effects of phytochemicals are thought to result from
the synergistic actions of multiple constituents as opposed to the action of isolated compounds. Absorption of
phytonutrients in the body is not a factor in obtaining phytonutrients. Macronutrients do not contain
phytonutrients, but micronutrients do contain phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are not found in abundance in
all foods; they are bioactive molecules found in plants.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal
the correct answer.

Question 50

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) daily recommendation for intake
of fruits and vegetables is based on which factor? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |n| Age
@ |n| Sex

@ [| Impact of intake on mortality
|_| Height and weight
|_| Risk factors for disease

So close!

Rationale

The CDC bases its recommendation for intake of fruits and vegetables on age, sex, and research findings
indicating the number of fruits and vegetables eaten and their impact on the risk for all-causes mortality.
Height, weight, and risk factors for disease are not factored into the daily recommendation for fruits and
vegetables.

p. 109
Question 51

Phytochemicals provide protective benefits against which condition? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Chronic disease

[| Osteomalacia
iv) [ml] Cardiovascular disease

[| Anencephaly

iv) [ml] Cancer

That's right!

Rationale

Phytochemicals offer protection against chronic disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Vitamin D offers
protection against osteomalacia. Adequate stores of folic acid before conception and during early gestation
reduce the risk for neural tube defects like anencephaly.

p. 108
Question 52

Vitamin deficiency can occur in patients in which condition? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Pregnancy
iv) [ml] Poverty
@ |B) Caffeine abuse

@ [) Drug or alcohol abuse

|_| Increased protein intake

That's right!

Rationale

Although vitamin deficiencies are no longer common among Americans, pregnant women are often at risk fc
marginal deficiencies of essential vitamins. Poverty has an overwhelmingly negative effect on the nutritional
status of children and adults. Chronic caffeine, drug, and alcohol abuse not only alter psychological and
mental capacities, but it also limits the body’s ability to absorb and use essential vitamins. Increasing protein
intake will not result in vitamin deficiency.

p. 110
Question 53

Which system is affected by a vitamin A deficiency?

iv) © Ocular

O Neurologic
O Musculoskeletal

O Endocrine

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin A deficiencies may cause night blindness, hardening of the cornea, and eye dryness. Vitamin A
deficiencies do not generally cause issues with the neurologic, musculoskeletal, or endocrine systems.

p. 88
Question 54

A patient states to the nurse, "| eat plenty of grains and fruits to help prevent cardiovascular

disease, so | don’t need a lot of vegetables." Which statement regarding this patient is
accurate?

© Additional vegetables in the diet are not needed at this time.
©) More fruits can be substituted for the vegetables not being eaten.

@ @ Vegetables should be added to obtain phytonutrients that some grains and fruits do not contain.

© Asupplement can be added to the diet for additional phytonutrients.

That's right!

Rationale

A patient eating grains and fruits should incorporate vegetables into the diet as well because vegetables have
other phytonutrients that benefit health. The patient should be advised to add vegetables to the diet.
Substituting more fruits in place of vegetables or encouraging the use of a supplement with the diet will not
provide the wide variety of phytonutrients that vegetables will.

p. 108
Question 55

Which trait best indicates the specific phytochemical a fruit or vegetable contains?

O Source

©) Degree of ripeness
© Category of food group

ivy) © Color

That's right!

Rationale

Color is one prominent indicator that a large quantity of a specific phytochemical is present in food. The
sources of fruits and vegetables do not correlate with the phytochemicals they contain. An unripe fruit or
vegetable may offer fewer phytonutrients, but ripeness does not indicate which phytochemical is present. The
category of a food group to which the vegetables and fruits belong does not provide information about the

specific phytochemicals they contain.

p. 108
Question 56

Which statement will the nurse make when teaching a patient about adequate intake of
fruits and vegetables?

@ ©@ ‘Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables each time you eat."
© "You should have a minimum of eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day."
© "Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables."

© "Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) dietary recommendations."

That's right!

Rationale

The best statement a nurse can make when teaching a patient about adequate intake of fruits and vegetables
is "Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables each time you eat." This provides a visual measure of how
many fruits and vegetables should be on the patient’s plate each time the patient eats. Recommending a
minimum of eight servings of fruits and vegetables a day for a patient is excessive. Telling the patient to
increase the intake of fruit and vegetables is vague and does not provide guidelines for the patient to follow.
Telling a patient to follow the CDC’s dietary recommendations is less helpful because it is not guaranteed that
the patient can access or understand the information.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will
seem like the correct response.

p. 108
Question 57

Fruits and vegetables of which color are the best source of the phytochemical anthocyanin?

© Yellow-green
© White-green

That's right!

Rationale

Red-purple fruits and vegetables are the best source of the phytochemical anthocyanin. Yellow-green produce
provides zeaxanthin. White-green produce contains allyl sulfides. Orange produce provides beta-carotene.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 108
Question 58

Which carotenoid cannot be converted into vitamin A? Select all that apply. One, some, or
all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

[| Beta carotene

@ [| Lycopene
@ [| Lutein

@ [| Zeaxanthin
@ [By Ally! sulfide

So close!

Rationale

Lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin are carotenoids that cannot be converted into vitamin A. Beta carotene is a
provitamin A carotenoid that can be converted by the body to retinol, which is a form of vitamin A. Allyl sulfide
is an organic compound that contains sulfur but is not a carotenoid. It is found in white-green foods and can
be converted into vitamin A.

p. 88
Question 59

Which food source provides the most phytonutrients?

That's right!

Rationale
Legumes are the greatest source of phytonutrients. Dairy, meat, and other foods that are derived from

animals and foods that have been processed and refined are virtually devoid of phytochemicals. However,

certain vegetable oils such as olive oil are a source of phytonutrients.

p. 108
Question 60

Which food is considered "nutrient empty"?
O Dairy
@ ©@ Refined grains

That's right!

Rationale
Refined grains are considered a "nutrient-empty" food. Dairy products, oils, and fruits are rich in nutrients and

are parts of the food groups necessary for functional health.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 108
Question 61

Which carotenoid found in yellow-green foods is specifically associated with the prevention
of age-related macular degeneration?

© Anthocyanin

O Glucosinolate

ivy) © Zeaxanthin

Lycopene
© lycop

That's right!

Rationale

Zeaxanthin is the carotenoid found in yellow-green foods that is associated with the prevention of age-related
macular degeneration. Anthocyanin, which is found in red-purple foods, is a flavonoid. Glucosinolate is a
nutrient found in green foods. Lycopene is a red carotene that is a powerful antioxidant.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 108
Question 62

Which action do phytonutrients display that aid in cancer prevention?
iv) © Promote antioxidant activity

© Impair RNA synthesis

O Increase immune response

© Improve cell signaling

That's right!

Rationale

Phytonutrients promote antioxidant activity, which works to protect the body from damage caused by free
radicals. Free radicals lead to oxidative stress, which is associated with an increased risk for cancer.
Phytonutrients impair DNA synthesis, not RNA synthesis. Vitamin A is required to help keep the body’s
immune response healthy. Vitamin E is responsible for improving cell signaling, specifically to drive gene
expression and antiproliferative effects in the eye that appear to be protective against conditions such as
glaucoma.

pp. 107-108
Question 63

Which characteristic of vitamin D is accurate?

© The only source is sunlight.
© The vitamin is required to maintain cell membranes.
@ ©@ It is measured in international units.

© Recommended daily amounts are combined with vitamin K.

That's right!

Rationale

Recommended daily doses of vitamin D are measured in international units. Although sunlight provides
vitamin D, a patient can also get it through dietary intake. Vitamin D does not play a role in maintaining cell
membranes. Vitamin K is produced in the intestine and does not need to be combined with vitamin D.

p.92
Question 64

Which system is sensitive to a vitamin D deficiency?

O Ocular

O Gastrointestinal

ivy) © Musculoskeletal

O Integumentary

That's right!

Rationale

Vitamin D deficiencies may cause rickets or osteomalacia, which are musculoskeletal disorders. Vitamin D
deficiencies do not generally cause issues with the ocular, gastrointestinal, or integumentary systems.

p.91
Question 65

Which B vitamin deficiency puts a patient at risk for Beriberi?
O B 2 (riboflavin)
O Be (pyridoxine)

@ © Bilthiamin)

© @ 8 3(niacin)

So close!

Rationale

Beriberi is a disease of the peripheral nerves caused by a deficiency of vitamin B }. It is characterized by
neuritis, paralysis of the legs and arms, cardiovascular changes, and edema. Vitamin B 2 deficiency places a
patient at risk for cracked lips and mouth corners; a swollen, red tongue; burning, itching, or tearing eyes
caused by extra blood vessels in the cornea; and a scaly, greasy dermatitis in the skin folds. Vitamin B 6
deficiency can cause abnormal central nervous system function with hyperirritability, neuritis, possible
convulsions, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. A deficiency in vitamin B 3 results in weakness, poor
appetite, indigestion, and various disorders of the skin and nervous system.

That's right!

Rationale

The daily recommended intake of calcium for a 30-year-old male is 1000 mg. The daily recommended intake
of calcium for a woman between the ages of 51 and 70 is 1200 mg. The tolerable upper intake level of calcium
per day is 2000 to 3000 mg, depending on age, and higher levels can result in toxicity.

p.117
Question 7

Which mineral accumulates in calcified tissues and protects teeth and bones from mineral

loss?

That's right!

Rationale
Fluoride accumulates in the body’s calcified tissues and protects teeth and bones from mineral loss. Calcium

is an essential mineral for construction and maintenance of bones and teeth. Copper is a component of cell
enzymes, is involved in energy production, and plays a role in hemoglobin synthesis. lodine is important for

the synthesis of thyroxin, which regulates cell metabolism and basal metabolic rates.

p. 132
Question 8

A deficiency in which mineral can cause symptoms of heart muscle weakness with possible

cardiac arrest?

ivy) © Potassium

O Magnesium

That's right!

Rationale

One of the characteristic symptoms of potassium deficiency is heart muscle weakness with possible cardiac
arrest. Calcium deficiency can cause osteoporosis due to factors that create an overall loss of bone density. A
deficiency of sodium can result in acid-base imbalances and muscle cramping but does not affect the heart.

Magnesium deficiency is rare but can cause cardiovascular and neurologic instability.

p.121
Question 9

What is the main function of sodium in the body?
O Blood clotting

O Bone and teeth formation
O Intracellular fluid control

@ @ Maintenance of body water balance

That's right!

Rationale

The main function of sodium is the maintenance of body water balance. Blood clotting is a function of
calcium. Calcium is also responsible for bone and teeth formation. Potassium controls intracellular fluid by
holding water inside the cells and counterbalancing the osmotic effect of sodium.

p. 120
Which characteristic differentiates major minerals from trace minerals?

© Major minerals are metabolized more quickly than trace minerals.
© Major minerals are more important to human nutrition than trace minerals.
@ @ Major minerals are found in larger amounts in the body than trace minerals.

© Major minerals have a recommended intake of less than 100 mg/day; trace minerals have a
recommended intake of more than 100 mg/day.

That's right!

Rationale

The difference between major minerals and trace minerals is that major minerals are found in larger amounts
in the body than trace minerals. Mineral metabolism is usually controlled at the point of intestinal absorption
and the point of tissue uptake, regardless of the class. The term major refers to the amount of a mineral in the
body and not its relative importance to human nutrition. Major minerals have a recommended intake of more
than 100 mg/day; trace minerals have a recommended intake of less than 100 mg/day.

p. 114
Question 11

Which food source is an exceptionally good source of selenium?
@ ©@ Brazil nuts

© Seafood

O Organ meats

© Whole grains

That's right!

Rationale
Brazil nuts are an exceptionally good source of selenium, with 1342 mcg per 1/2-cup serving. Although

seafood is a good source of selenium, the quantity varies. Organ meats are a consistently good source of
selenium, but the amount depends on the quantity of selenium in the soil used to graze animals. Selenium

can be found in whole grains, but the quantity varies.

p. 132
Question 12

A deficiency in which trace mineral can cause anemia?

That's right!

Rationale
A deficiency in iron can cause anemia. Insufficient iodine intake can cause thyroid disorders. Zinc deficiency

can result in compromised immunity. Selenium deficiency can cause impaired immune function.

p. 125
Question 13

Which major mineral creates a dependent glucose transporter that allows the passage of
glucose and galactose from the intestinal lumen into the intestinal cell?

O Potassium

O Zinc

O Chromium

ivy) © Sodium

That's right!

Rationale

Sodium creates a dependent glucose transporter that allows the passage of glucose and galactose from the
intestinal lumen into the intestinal cells. Potassium plays a role in energy production by converting glucose
into stored glycogen. Zinc is an essential enzyme constituent, which includes storage of insulin. Chromium is
thought to be an essential component of the organic complex glucose factor, which stimulates the action of

insulin.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall

Question 14

The nurse knows that a patient who has participated in strenuous exercise over a period of
several hours is at risk for which electrolyte imbalance?

iv) © Hyponatremia

© Hypocalcemia
O Hypernatremia

© Hyperkalemia

That's right!

Rationale

A patient who has participated in strenuous exercise over several hours is at risk for hyponatremia. Although
sweat is relatively low in sodium, prolonged sweating results in sodium loss. The patient is not at risk for
hypernatremia in this setting, which typically occurs with inadequate water intake or excessive water loss
without replacement. Hypocalcemia is related to conditions such as hypoparathyroidism, malnutrition, or
malabsorption. Hyperkalemia is associated with renal impairment or tissue breakdown, whereas sweating is
more likely to cause potassium loss and possible hypokalemia.

p. 120
Question 15

Which disease is associated with excessive sodium intake?

iv) O Hypertension
tx} © Hypernatremia

© Hyperthyroidism

So close!

Rationale

Hypertension is associated with excessive sodium intake. Edema is excessive fluid in the extracellular space
and is a medical term for swelling. It is not a disease, but a clinical finding. Hypernatremia is not a disease; it
is an electrolyte imbalance in which serum sodium is high. Hyperthyroidism is not caused by excessive
sodium intake; the most common cause of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune disorder Graves disease.

p. 124
Question 16

Which is a function of chloride?
@ @ Maintaining acid-base balance

© Opposing the action of sodium
© Killing bacteria in food that enters the stomach

© Activating pepsin enzymes to break down protein

That's right!

Rationale

Chloride helps maintain the body’s acid-base balance. It does not oppose the action of sodium; it has a
negatively charged ion that passively follows sodium, which has a positively charged ion. Hydrochloric acid is
secreted in gastric juices and kills bacteria in food that enters the stomach. Hydrochloric acid also activates the

pepsin enzymes to break down protein. Chloride is only one component of hydrochloric acid.

p. 122
Question 17

During the chloride shift, which ions move out of the red blood cell (RBC) and into the
plasma as chloride ions move into the RBC and out of the plasma, maintaining the balance

of negative charges on either side of the RBC membrane?

O Sodium
ivy) © Bicarbonate

O Potassium
© Hydrogen

That's right!

Rationale
During the chloride shift, bicarbonate ions move out of the RBC and into the plasma as chloride ions move

into the RBC and out of the plasma, maintaining the balance of negative charges on either side of the RBC

membrane. Sodium has an inverse relationship with potassium, and both have positively charged ions.

Hydrogen is a chemical gas with a positive charge.

p. 122
Question 18

Which is the primary cause of a chloride deficiency?

tx} © Diarrhea

O Menkes disease

©) Low dietary intake

ivy) O Vomiting

So close!

Rationale

The primary cause of chloride deficiency is excessive loss of hydrochloric acid through vomiting. Diarrhea
results in a loss of several electrolytes, including chloride, but it is not the primary reason for a chloride
deficiency. Menkes disease is an inborn error of metabolism that involves copper. A dietary deficiency of
chloride does not occur under normal circumstances.

p. 122
Question 19

Where is chloride primarily found in the body?
© Intracellular fluid compartments
© All body tissues
© Small intestine

@ ©@ Extracellular fluid compartments

That's right!

Rationale
Chloride is primarily found in the extracellular fluid compartments. Potassium is primarily found in the

intercellular fluid compartments. Chloride is not found in actual body tissue; it is found in the extracellular

fluid compartments. The majority of chloride is not found in the small intestine.

So close!

Rationale

Minerals are involved in activating, transmitting, regulating, and controlling metabolic processes. Minerals are
transported throughout the body, but they do not do the transferring themselves.

p. 114
Question 21

Which mineral is essential to blood clotting?

O lron

O Chromium

ivy) © Calcium
O Selenium

That's right!

Rationale

Calcium is essential for the formation of fibrin, which is the protein matrix of a blood clot. Iron is bound to
heme and forms the organic compound hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to the body’s
tissues and the carbon dioxide out of the tissue back to the lungs. Chromium is an essential component of the
organic complex glucose tolerance factor, which stimulates the action of insulin. Selenium is the important
part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which protects the lipids in cell membranes from

oxidative damage.

p. 115
Question 22

The nurse knows that sulfur enhances the structure of which body part? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
@ [By] Hair
@ [mm] Skin
|] Bone
@ [Bm] Nails
|_| Blood

That's right!

Rationale

Sulfur enhances the structure of hair, skin, and nails. Calcium has effects on bone and blood.

p. 123
Question 23

Which mineral is essential in binding oxygen or carbon dioxide to hemoglobin during the
respiratory cycle?

O Potassium

© Phosphorus

O Protein
ivy) © lron

That's right!

Rationale

lron is a trace element that helps bind oxygen to hemoglobin for transport to cells and carbon dioxide to
hemoglobin for return to the lungs. Potassium is an electrolyte vital for normal cardiac functioning and is
crucial to skeletal and smooth muscle contraction. Phosphorus is an essential mineral that plays an important
role in formation of bones and teeth. Proteins are large, complex molecules necessary for structure, function,

and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs.

p. 125
Question 24

What is the basic function of iodine in the body?
@ ©@ Synthesizing thyroxine

© Carrying oxygen to body cells

© Forming bones and teeth

©) Producing red blood cells

That's right!

Rationale

The basic function of iodine in the body is the synthesis of thyroxine. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to body
cells. Phosphorus forms bones and teeth. Iron assists the body in the production of red blood cells.

p. 127
Question 25

The novice nurse is teaching a patient about hypothyroidism. Which statement made by the
nurse requires correction by the preceptor?

© "Be sure the salt used for cooking and seasoning is iodized."
©) "Seafood such as salmon or shellfish are good sources of iodine."

© "Eggs, cow’s milk, and cheese contain iodine."

@ ©@ ‘Avoid dairy products, eggs, shellfish, and iodized salt in the diet."

That's right!

Rationale

Avoiding dairy products, eggs, shellfish, and iodized salt will further reduce iodine and worsen dietary
hypothyroidism. In the United States, dietary hypothyroidism is rare because of iodized salt often used in
cooking and seasoning. Seafood such as salmon and shellfish are good sources of iodine and should be
recommended. Eggs, cow’s milk, and cheese also contain iodine and should be recommended for dietary
hypothyroidism.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p. 128,p. 130
Question 26

Which statement made by a pregnant patient indicates understanding of the role of zinc in
the diet?

@ ©@ "Poor zinc intake in pregnancy can result in congenital malformations."
© "Poor zinc intake in pregnancy can result in premature births."
© "Poor zinc intake in pregnancy can result in maternal hypertension."

© "Zinc deficiency in pregnancy is the most common cause of preventable brain damage."

That's right!

Rationale

The statement "Poor zinc intake in pregnancy can result in congenital malformations" indicates an
understanding of the role of zinc in the diet. Poor zinc intake is not associated with premature births, and zinc
has no effect on blood pressure. lodine is the most common deficiency causing preventable brain damage
during pregnancy.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no
pattern to the answers.

p. 134
Question 27

Selenium, an essential part of an antioxidant enzyme, protects cells and lipid membranes

from which process?
O Apoptosis
© Glycolysis

@ @ Oxidative damage
© Anabolism damage

That's right!

Rationale

Selenium is an integral part of an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells and lipid membranes from oxidative
damage. Apoptosis is a term used to describe cellular suicide. Glycolysis is the process that allows glucose to
be broken down into usable energy. Anabolism is the process by which the body uses energy released by

catabolism to synthesize complex molecules used to form cellular structures.

p. 132
Question 28

Selenium functions as which component in the body?

iv) © Antioxidant

O Free radical

© Coagulator

O Neutron

That's right!

Rationale

Selenium is a trace mineral found in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and it functions as an antioxidant.
Free radicals are molecules capable of independent existence that contain an unpaired electronic in an atomic
orbital. Coagulator is a general term describing something that assists in blood clotting. A neutron is an

elementary particle having no charge.

p. 132
Question 29

The nurse is caring for a patient with a selenium deficiency. For which disease is the patient
at risk?

O Balo disease

O Crohn’s disease

O CREST disease
ivy) © Kashin-Bek disease

That's right!

Rationale

Kashin-Bek disease is caused by selenium deficiency and can lead to heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Balo
disease is a rare, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that has no relation to selenium
deficiency. Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease and is not caused by selenium deficiency. CREST
disease is a connective tissue disordered characterized by changes in the skin, blood vessels, skeletal muscles,

and internal organs and has no relationship to selenium deficiency.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think they will recognize the
right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This is a
dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices will

seem like the correct response.

p. 132
Question 30

Which food is rich in molybdenum? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may

be correct.

@ [B) Whole grains

[| Chicken

iv) [ml] Legumes

|_| String beans

@ [B) Leafy vegetables
|_| Coffee

That's right!

Rationale
Foods rich in molybdenum include whole grains, legumes, and leafy vegetables. Most animal products such
as chicken, vegetables such as string beans, and fruit are poor dietary sources of molybdenum. Foods

containing caffeine such as coffee, cocoa, or tea are poor dietary sources of molybdenum.

p. 134
Question 31

Which food is the best source of phosphorus?

@ © Eszgs

O Tomatoes

That's right!

Rationale
Eggs are the best source of dietary phosphorus. Legumes such as lentils and nuts do not have a high

bioavailability of phosphorus. Tomatoes are low in phosphorus.

p. 120
Question 32

Which assessment findings may indicate that the patient is not consuming adequate

amounts of iodine?

©) Muscle weakness and pain, leg cramps, constipation
© Extreme fatigue, weakness, pallor, spoon-shaped nails
@ ©@ Goiter, choking when lying flat, difficulty swallowing

© Facial twitching upon tapping cranial nerve VII

That's right!

Rationale

Low iodine in the diet can result in a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). The patient with a goiter often complains
of a choking sensation when lying down, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. Muscle weakness and myalgia, leg
cramping, and constipation are signs and symptoms of hypokalemia. Patients with iron deficiency anemia
often complain of extreme fatigue and weakness and have pallor and spoon-shaped nails. Facial twitching that
occurs with tapping on cranial nerve VII is known as Chvostek sign, which is caused by hypocalcemia, or low

levels of calcium.

p. 128
Question 33

Which role does iodine play in the body?
© Exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body

© Maintains water balance, acid-base balance, and cell permeability
©) Promotes healthy teeth and bones, blood clotting, and nerve transmission

@ ©@ Produces thyroid hormones that control the body’s metabolism

That's right!

Rationale

lodine is necessary for producing thyroid hormones T 4 and T 3, which are significant in the body’s
metabolism. Iron is "pocketed" in the heme molecule, a constituent of hemoglobin responsible for carrying
oxygen to all body cells returning carbon dioxide to the lungs. Sodium is necessary for water balance, acid-
base balance, and cellular permeability. Calcium is found in the bones and teeth and plays a role in blood
clotting and nerve transmission.

Test-Taking Tip: Key words or phrases in the question stem such as first, primary, early, or best are important.
Similarly, words such as only, always, never, and all in the alternatives are frequently evidence of a wrong
response. No real absolutes exist in life; every rule has its exceptions, so answer with care.

p. 127
Question 34

Which food source provides the highest amount of potassium?
© Spinach

tx} © Egg yolk

@ © Soybeans

O Organ meats

So close!

Rationale

Soybeans, raw or roasted, offer the highest source of potassium. Spinach is an excellent source of magnesium
and iron. Egg yolks are a good source of iron and other minerals. Organ meats are an excellent source of

molybdenum.

p. 122
Question 35

Which statement by a patient following nutritional counseling indicates an understanding
of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iodine?

© "The RDA for iodine is 65 yg for women."
© "The RDA for iodine is 160 yg for men."
@ ©@ "The RDA for men and women is 150 pg."

© "The RDA for pregnant women is 150 pg."

That's right!

Rationale

The statement "The RDA for men and women is 150 pg" demonstrates that the teaching by the nutritionist is
effective. The RDA of iodine for children 4 to 8 years old is 65 pg. The RDA of iodine for men is 150 pg, not
160 pg. The RDA for pregnant women is 160 yg, not 150 pg.

p. 134
Question 36

Which mineral accumulates in calcified tissues and protects teeth and bones from mineral

loss?

That's right!

Rationale
Fluoride accumulates in the body’s calcified tissues and protects teeth and bones from mineral loss. Calcium

is an essential mineral for construction and maintenance of bones and teeth. Copper is a component of cell
enzymes, is involved in energy production, and plays a role in hemoglobin synthesis. lodine is important for

the synthesis of thyroxin, which regulates cell metabolism and basal metabolic rates.

Question 37

The nurse is assessing a patient with iron-deficiency anemia. Which sign or symptom might
the nurse observe? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Reports of fatigue

|_| Nerve degeneration

iv) [ml] Pale skin color

[| Low B j3 level in blood

@ [| Spoon-shaped nails
@ [BB] Shortness of breath

That's right!

Rationale

Fatigue, pallor, spoon-shaped nails, and shortness of breath are consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. Nerve
degeneration and low serum B j) levels are consistent with a diagnosis of pernicious anemia.

p. 125
Question 38

A deficiency in which mineral can cause symptoms of heart muscle weakness with possible
cardiac arrest?

That's right!

Rationale

One of the characteristic symptoms of potassium deficiency is heart muscle weakness with possible cardiac

arrest. Calcium deficiency can cause osteoporosis due to factors that create an overall loss of bone density. A
deficiency of sodium can result in acid-base imbalances and muscle cramping but does not affect the heart.
Magnesium deficiency is rare but can cause cardiovascular and neurologic instability.

p.121
Question 39

What is the main function of sodium in the body?
O Blood clotting

O Bone and teeth formation
O Intracellular fluid control

@ @ Maintenance of body water balance

That's right!

Rationale

The main function of sodium is the maintenance of body water balance. Blood clotting is a function of
calcium. Calcium is also responsible for bone and teeth formation. Potassium controls intracellular fluid by
holding water inside the cells and counterbalancing the osmotic effect of sodium.

p. 120
Question 40

Which characteristic differentiates major minerals from trace minerals?

© Major minerals are metabolized more quickly than trace minerals.
© Major minerals are more important to human nutrition than trace minerals.
@ @ Major minerals are found in larger amounts in the body than trace minerals.

© Major minerals have a recommended intake of less than 100 mg/day; trace minerals have a
recommended intake of more than 100 mg/day.

That's right!

Rationale

The difference between major minerals and trace minerals is that major minerals are found in larger amounts
in the body than trace minerals. Mineral metabolism is usually controlled at the point of intestinal absorption
and the point of tissue uptake, regardless of the class. The term major refers to the amount of a mineral in the
body and not its relative importance to human nutrition. Major minerals have a recommended intake of more
than 100 mg/day; trace minerals have a recommended intake of less than 100 mg/day.

p. 114
Question 41

Which food source is an exceptionally good source of selenium?
@ ©@ Brazil nuts

© Seafood

O Organ meats

© Whole grains

That's right!

Rationale
Brazil nuts are an exceptionally good source of selenium, with 1342 mcg per 1/2-cup serving. Although

seafood is a good source of selenium, the quantity varies. Organ meats are a consistently good source of
selenium, but the amount depends on the quantity of selenium in the soil used to graze animals. Selenium

can be found in whole grains, but the quantity varies.

p. 132
Question 42

A deficiency in which trace mineral can cause anemia?

That's right!

Rationale
A deficiency in iron can cause anemia. Insufficient iodine intake can cause thyroid disorders. Zinc deficiency

can result in compromised immunity. Selenium deficiency can cause impaired immune function.

p. 125
Question 43

Which major mineral creates a dependent glucose transporter that allows the passage of
glucose and galactose from the intestinal lumen into the intestinal cell?

O Potassium

O Zinc

O Chromium

ivy) © Sodium

That's right!

Rationale

Sodium creates a dependent glucose transporter that allows the passage of glucose and galactose from the
intestinal lumen into the intestinal cells. Potassium plays a role in energy production by converting glucose
into stored glycogen. Zinc is an essential enzyme constituent, which includes storage of insulin. Chromium is
thought to be an essential component of the organic complex glucose factor, which stimulates the action of

insulin.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually, at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 120
Question 44

The nurse knows that a patient who has participated in strenuous exercise over a period of
several hours is at risk for which electrolyte imbalance?

iv) © Hyponatremia

© Hypocalcemia
O Hypernatremia

© Hyperkalemia

That's right!

Rationale

A patient who has participated in strenuous exercise over several hours is at risk for hyponatremia. Although
sweat is relatively low in sodium, prolonged sweating results in sodium loss. The patient is not at risk for
hypernatremia in this setting, which typically occurs with inadequate water intake or excessive water loss
without replacement. Hypocalcemia is related to conditions such as hypoparathyroidism, malnutrition, or
malabsorption. Hyperkalemia is associated with renal impairment or tissue breakdown, whereas sweating is
more likely to cause potassium loss and possible hypokalemia.

p. 120
Question 45

Which disease is associated with excessive sodium intake?

© Edema
iv) © Hypertension

O Hypernatremia
© Hyperthyroidism

That's right!

Rationale

Hypertension is associated with excessive sodium intake. Edema is excessive fluid in the extracellular space
and is a medical term for swelling. It is not a disease, but a clinical finding. Hypernatremia is not a disease; it
is an electrolyte imbalance in which serum sodium is high. Hyperthyroidism is not caused by excessive
sodium intake; the most common cause of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune disorder Graves disease.

p. 124
Question 46

Which food is a natural, unprocessed source of sodium? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ (my) Milk
@ [| Broccoli
@ [| Fees
|] Ham
@ [| Chicken

So close!

Rationale

Natural, unprocessed sources of sodium include milk, broccoli, eggs, and chicken. Ham is a processed food

source containing high amounts of sodium.

p.121
Question 47

What is the potassium-sodium ratio recommended by the dietary approaches to stop
hypertension (DASH) diet?

© ©@ Increased potassium, decreased sodium

©) Decreased potassium, increased sodium
@ © Equal intake of potassium and sodium

O No specific potassium-sodium ratio

So close!

Rationale

According to the DASH diet, an equal intake of potassium and sodium can help prevent the development of
hypertension. Increased potassium and decreased sodium, decreased potassium and increased sodium, and
no specific potassium-sodium ratio are not recommendations of the DASH diet and are not known to prevent
hypertension.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly
answering each question.

p.121
Question 48

Which is a function of chloride?
@ @ Maintaining acid-base balance

© Opposing the action of sodium
© Killing bacteria in food that enters the stomach

© Activating pepsin enzymes to break down protein

That's right!

Rationale

Chloride helps maintain the body’s acid-base balance. It does not oppose the action of sodium; it has a
negatively charged ion that passively follows sodium, which has a positively charged ion. Hydrochloric acid is
secreted in gastric juices and kills bacteria in food that enters the stomach. Hydrochloric acid also activates the

pepsin enzymes to break down protein. Chloride is only one component of hydrochloric acid.

p. 122
Question 49

During the chloride shift, which ions move out of the red blood cell (RBC) and into the
plasma as chloride ions move into the RBC and out of the plasma, maintaining the balance

of negative charges on either side of the RBC membrane?

O Potassium

Hydrogen
© Hydrog

That's right!

Rationale
During the chloride shift, bicarbonate ions move out of the RBC and into the plasma as chloride ions move

into the RBC and out of the plasma, maintaining the balance of negative charges on either side of the RBC
membrane. Sodium has an inverse relationship with potassium, and both have positively charged ions.

Hydrogen is a chemical gas with a positive charge.

p. 122
Question 50

Which can cause chloride toxicity?
@ @ Severe dehydration

©) Prolonged use of supplements
© Adiet high in processed foods

© Exceeding the recommended upper intake level

That's right!

Rationale

The only known dietary cause of chloride toxicity occurs as a result of severe dehydration. Prolonged use of
supplements is not a factor in chloride toxicity. A diet high in processed foods contains a significant amount
of sodium chloride (salt) but does not cause chloride toxicity. There is no recommended upper intake level of
chloride, making toxicity highly unlikely.

p. 122
Question 51

Which is the primary cause of a chloride deficiency?
©) Diarrhea

O Menkes disease

©) Low dietary intake

ivy) © Vomiting

That's right!

Rationale

The primary cause of chloride deficiency is excessive loss of hydrochloric acid through vomiting. Diarrhea
results in a loss of several electrolytes, including chloride, but it is not the primary reason for a chloride
deficiency. Menkes disease is an inborn error of metabolism that involves copper. A dietary deficiency of

chloride does not occur under normal circumstances.

p. 122
Question 52

Where is chloride primarily found in the body?
© Intracellular fluid compartments
© All body tissues
© Small intestine

@ ©@ Extracellular fluid compartments

That's right!

Rationale
Chloride is primarily found in the extracellular fluid compartments. Potassium is primarily found in the

intercellular fluid compartments. Chloride is not found in actual body tissue; it is found in the extracellular

fluid compartments. The majority of chloride is not found in the small intestine.

p. 120
Question 53

Which role does magnesium have in the body? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [_| Involved in the secretion of thyroxine
@ [_] Involved in nerve impulses

@ [BB] Cofactor in activating amino acids

© |B] Essential constituent of cell protein

[| Prevention of dental caries

So close!

Rationale

Magnesium is involved in the secretion of thyroxine and in nerve impulses that stimulate muscle contraction.
It is also a cofactor in activating amino acids for protein synthesis. Sulfur is an essential constituent of cell
protein. Fluoride prevents dental caries.

p. 123
Question 54

In which metabolic process are minerals involved? Select all that apply. One, some, or all

responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [_| Activating
@ [B] Transmitting
@ [| Regulating
© [B] Transferring
@ [| Controlling

So close!

Rationale

Minerals are involved in activating, transmitting, regulating, and controlling metabolic processes. Minerals are
transported throughout the body, but they do not do the transferring themselves.

p. 114
Question 55

Which mineral is essential to blood clotting?

O lron

O Chromium

ivy) © Calcium
O Selenium

That's right!

Rationale

Calcium is essential for the formation of fibrin, which is the protein matrix of a blood clot. Iron is bound to
heme and forms the organic compound hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to the body’s
tissues and the carbon dioxide out of the tissue back to the lungs. Chromium is an essential component of the
organic complex glucose tolerance factor, which stimulates the action of insulin. Selenium is the important
part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which protects the lipids in cell membranes from

oxidative damage.

p. 115
Question 56

The nurse knows that sulfur enhances the structure of which body part? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.
@ [By] Hair
@ [mm] Skin
|] Bone
@ [Bm] Nails
|_| Blood

That's right!

Rationale

Sulfur enhances the structure of hair, skin, and nails. Calcium has effects on bone and blood.

p. 123
Question 57

What is the maximum daily recommended dietary intake of magnesium for an adult

woman?

@ © 320mg
© 274mg
© 400 mg

© @ 350mg

So close!

Rationale

The maximum daily recommended dietary intake of magnesium for an adult woman is 320 mg. The average
dietary consumption for an adult woman is 274 mg. The recommended dietary daily intake for an adult male
is 400 mg. The tolerable upper intake level from supplements, not dietary intake, is 350 mg.

p. 124
Question 58

Which mineral is essential in binding oxygen or carbon dioxide to hemoglobin during the
respiratory cycle?

O Potassium

© Phosphorus

O Protein
ivy) © lron

That's right!

Rationale

lron is a trace element that helps bind oxygen to hemoglobin for transport to cells and carbon dioxide to
hemoglobin for return to the lungs. Potassium is an electrolyte vital for normal cardiac functioning and is
crucial to skeletal and smooth muscle contraction. Phosphorus is an essential mineral that plays an important
role in formation of bones and teeth. Proteins are large, complex molecules necessary for structure, function,

and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs.

p. 125
Question 59

The nurse is teaching a pregnant patient in good general health about the importance of
iron intake. How many milligrams of iron does the nurse recommend the patient consume

daily?
O?

O@® 27
O 33
© 60

That's right!

Rationale

The nurse recommends that the pregnant patient consume 27 mg of iron per day. This is beyond normal daily
intake of iron for nonpregnant women. For the lactating patient, 9 mg of iron is recommended a day. The
amounts 33 mg and 60 mg are more than necessary for the patient.

p. 125
Question 60

What is the basic function of iodine in the body?
@ ©@ Synthesizing thyroxine

© Carrying oxygen to body cells

© Forming bones and teeth

©) Producing red blood cells

That's right!

Rationale

The basic function of iodine in the body is the synthesis of thyroxine. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to body
cells. Phosphorus forms bones and teeth. Iron assists the body in the production of red blood cells.

Question 1

Which mechanism does the body use to maintain a constant flow of fluid through the
tissues and carry materials to and from the cells? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Hydrostatic pressure
@ [BB] Colloidal osmotic pressure

[|_| Chemical buffer system
|__| Physiologic buffer system

[_] Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

That's right!

Rationale

The body maintains this constant flow of fluid through the tissues and carries materials to and from the cells
by means of hydrostatic pressure and colloidal osmotic pressure. Chemical and physiologic buffer systems
and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are not directly involved in maintaining a constant flow of fluid
through the tissues and carries materials to and from the cells. Chemical and physiologic buffer systems are
important mechanisms for maintaining the blood pH within an acceptable range for life. The renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system is a complex hormonal system that corrects for hypovolemia through a
negative feedback mechanism.

p.146
Question 2

Which process involves movement of water and solutes across membrane with assistance

from cell membrane transporters?
© Diffusion

O Osmosis

ivy) © Facilitated diffusion
O Pinocytosis

That's right!

Rationale

In facilitated diffusion, membrane transporters assist particles with the crossing of the membrane. Cell
membrane transporters are not involved in diffusion, osmosis, or pinocytosis. In simple diffusion, particles
move outward in all directions from an area of greater concentration of particles to an area of lesser
concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area with a low solute concentration to
an area with a high solute concentration. In pinocytosis, large molecules attach themselves to the cell
membrane, whereby the cell engulfs them encased in a vacuole. In this cavity, nutrient particles are carried
across the cell membrane and into the cell. Once inside the cell, the vacuole opens, and cell enzymes

metabolize the particles.

Test-Taking Tip: Attempt to select the answer that is most complete and includes the other answers within it.
For example, a stem might read, "A child's intelligence is influenced by what?" and three options might be
genetic inheritance, environmental factors, and past experiences. The fourth option might be multiple factors,

which is a more inclusive choice and therefore the correct answer.

p.146
Question 3

Which particle is too large to pass through the walls of capillaries?
© Water molecule

© Electrolytes
O Nutrient constituents

@ ©@ Plasma protein molecule

That's right!

Rationale

The walls of capillaries are thin and porous. Larger particles such as plasma protein molecules cannot pass
through the small pores of the capillary membrane. Water molecules and small particles, including
electrolytes and various nutrient constituents, can move freely through the capillary membrane.

p.145
Question 4

Which large molecular size organic compound is responsible for maintaining integrity of
the blood volume by exerting colloidal osmotic pressure (COP)?

©) Glucose
@ ©@ Plasma proteins

That's right!

Rationale

Plasma proteins (called colloids) exert COP to maintain the integrity of the blood volume. Glucose, anions, and
cations are not responsible for maintaining integrity of the blood volume by exerting colloidal osmotic
pressure. Glucose are small organic compounds that produce movement of water in uncharacteristic high
concentration scenarios. Cations and anions are electrolytes that maintain electrical neutrality.

p.145
Question 5

Which output route is responsible for the largest amount of water exiting from the body?

That's right!

Rationale

Water leaves the body through the kidneys, skin, lungs, and feces. Of these output routes, the largest amount
of water exits through the kidneys. The output of water by the kidneys is 1400 mL/day. In contrast, the output
of water by lungs is 350 mL/day, output of water by anus is 200 mL/day, and the output of water by sweat is
100 mL/day.

p. 143
Question 6

Which factor can make older adults vulnerable to chronic hypohydration? Select all that
apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

|_| Polydipsia
@ [BB] Physiologic changes to the hypothalamus

iv) [ml] Increase in urine volume

@ [| Decrease in fluid resorption

Psychotropic drugs
y P 8

So close!

Rationale

Dehydration presents special concerns among older adults. Age-associated physiologic changes to the
hypothalamus and renal system, such as an increase in urine volume and decrease in fluid resorption, coupled
with a decline in fluid intake, make this population vulnerable to chronic hypohydration. Polydipsia, or
excessive thirst and drinking, and psychotropic drugs are risk factors for water intoxication, not dehydration.

p.141
Question 7

Which factor makes high fluid intake critical during infancy?
© Breast milk has a diuretic effect.

@ © An infant’s body content of water is particularly high.
© A relatively large amount of an infant's body water is inside of the cells.

© Infants are prone to diseases.

That's right!

Rationale

High fluid intake (via breast milk or breast milk substitute) is critical during infancy because an infant’s body
content of water is particularly high (approximately 70% to 75% of their total body weight) and because a
relatively large amount of this body water is outside of the cells and thus is more easily lost. Breast milk does
not have a diuretic effect. A relatively large amount of an infant’s body water is outside of the cells. Infants
being prone to diseases is not a factor that makes high fluid intake critical during infancy.

p. 140
Question 8

Which factor increases the body’s requirement for water at a high altitude? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

@ |B] Elevated respiratory water loss

@ |B) Cold-induced diuresis

@ [BB] Increased energy expenditure
|_|] High body temperature

|_| Water loss through sweat

That's right!

Rationale

Cold temperatures and altitude result in elevated respiratory water loss, hypoxia- or cold-induced diuresis,
and increased energy expenditure, all of which raise water needs. Body temperature and environmental
temperature decrease with altitude. Therefore high body temperature and sweating are not factors that

increase the body’s requirement for water in high altitude.

p. 139
Question 9

Which value represents the adequate intake of total water for pregnant women?

O 2.7L
@ © 3.0L
© 3.5L
© @ 3.8L

So close!

Rationale

The adequate intake value of total water for pregnant women is 3.0 L. This includes 2.7 L from beverages and
0.7 L from food. A pregnant woman needs more water than an adult woman who in not pregnant.
Consuming less than 3 L of water per day is inadequate and more than 3 L is excessive.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary
circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

p.139
Question 10

Which function of body water is critical for homeostasis? Select all that apply. One, some,

or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Lubricant
iv) [ml] Solvent
iv) [ml] Transport

@ [B) Thermoregulation

[_] Cleansing solution

That's right!

Rationale

Body water has a lubricating effect on moving parts of the body. Water also acts as the basic liquid or solvent
for all chemical reactions within the body. Water circulates throughout the body and carries many important
materials to meet the needs of cells. Water is also necessary to help maintain a stable body temperature. Water

does not act as a cleansing solution for the body.

pp. 138-139
Question 11

Which condition is a patient who has been vomiting for 3 days at risk for?

O Metabolic acidosis
iv) © Metabolic alkalosis

© Respiratory acidosis
© Respiratory alkalosis

That's right!

Rationale

Metabolic alkalosis is defined as a pH greater than 7.45. Metabolic alkalosis is seen with extensive vomiting in
which a significant amount of hydrochloric acid is lost and bicarbonate is secreted. Metabolic acidosis is
caused by a variety of conditions that cause the excess accumulation of acids in the body or by a significant
loss of bicarbonate. Respiratory acidosis is caused by an accumulation of carbon dioxide. Respiratory alkalosis
is caused by hyperventilation and an excess loss of carbon dioxide.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago

had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 150
Question 12

Which pH level reflects metabolic acidosis?

That's right!

Rationale

Metabolic acidosis is demonstrated by a pH level less than 7.35. Therefore, 7.15 is the correct answer. The pH
is a negative mathematical factor; therefore the higher the hydrogen ion content, the lower the pH number. A
pH level of 7.75, 7.55, and 7.35 would not be indicative of acidosis.

Test-Taking Tip: Look for options that are similar in nature. If all are correct, either the question is poor or all
options are incorrect, the latter of which is more likely. Example: If the answer you are seeking is directed to a
specific treatment and all but one option deal with signs and symptoms, you would be correct in choosing the

treatment-specific option.

p.150
Question 13

Which description of the fluids and blood involved in gastrointestinal circulation is
accurate?

© ©@ Intracellular fluid is isotonic.

@ © Extracellular fluid is isotonic.
© Intracellular fluid is hypotonic.
© Extracellular fluid is hypotonic.

So close!

Rationale

The gastrointestinal fluids and blood in circulation are both part of the extracellular fluid (ECF). These fluids
are isotonic, which means that they are in a state of equal osmotic pressure from equivalent concentrations of
electrolytes and other solute particles. Extracellular fluid is not hypotonic.

p.147
Question 14

Which gastrointestinal secretion is mostly made of water? Select all that apply. One, some,
or all responses may be correct.

© (ml Bile

@ [m) Saliva

@ |B) Gastric juice
@ [BB] Intestinal juice
@ |B) Pancreatic juice

So close!

Rationale

Gastrointestinal circulation helps protect the homeostasis of body water. Saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice,
and intestinal juice are mostly made up of water. Bile is the one gastric fluid secretion that is not
predominately water.

p. 147
Question 15

Which control within the body is the most important for maintaining homeostasis?

O Osmosis
tx} © Diffusion

© Facilitated diffusion
@ © Capillary fluid shift mechanism

So close!

Rationale

The capillary fluid shift mechanism uses a combination of membrane transport methods to perform a
balancing act between opposing fluid pressures. It is one of the body’s most important controls for
maintaining homeostasis. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of low solute
concentration to an area of high solute concentration. Diffusion applies to the particles in a solution.

Facilitated diffusion follows the same principles as simple diffusion but also includes membrane transporters
that assist particles with the crossing of the membrane.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If

you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices that you believe are wrong and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p. 146
Question 16

Which food has the highest water content?

© Raw apple
O Raw carrots

O Raw banana

ivy) © Raw broccoli

That's right!

Rationale

Water enters the body as water in liquids, water in foods, and as a product of cell oxidation when the body
burns macronutrients for energy. If a patient is having trouble consuming enough water in liquid form, one
can also take water in through food. Raw broccoli has the highest water content at 89%; raw carrots contain
approximately 88% water; raw apples contain 86%; and raw bananas contain 75%.

p. 144
Question 17

Which statement correctly describes the body’s water balance? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

@ [BB] Fluid and electrolyte balance are related.
|_| Sodium is an anion that carries a negative charge.
@ [BB] Electrolytes can move freely across most membranes.
@ [BB] Potassium is a cation that helps maintain cell membrane potentials.

@ [BB] Medications can affect a person's water balance.

That's right!

Rationale

The two particles that control water balance in the body are plasma proteins and electrolytes. Fluid and
electrolytes are intimately related; an imbalance in one creates an imbalance in the other. Electrolytes are
small and can freely diffuse across most membranes of the body. Cations are positively charged ions and
include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. The constant balance between electrolytes maintains
the electrochemical and cell membrane potentials. Several drugs interact with the body's fluid balance, such as
diuretics which work directly to reduce the amount of fluid in the body, or psychiatric medications that may
have side effects that affect fluid balance. Sodium is a cation, not an anion.

pp. 142-143
Question 18

Which description correctly identifies intracellular and extracellular fluid?

© Intracellular fluid bathes the tissues.
©) Intracellular fluid is within the lymphatic circulation.
© Extracellular fluid makes up 35% to 45% of total body weight.

@ ©@ Extracellular fluid is contained in the intravascular compartment.

That's right!

Rationale

Extracellular fluid is the total body water outside of the cell. One fourth of extracellular fluid is contained in
the blood plasma or the intravascular component. The remaining extracellular fluid is composed of interstitial
fluids, including the water that bathes the tissue, the water within the lymphatic system, and transcellular
fluid. Intracellular fluid is the total body water inside the cell; it makes up 35% to 45% of total body weight.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no

pattern to the answers.

p.142
Question 19

A patient is admitted to the hospital with a serum sodium level of 125 mEq/L. The patient
has a history of psychogenic polydipsia. Which cause is the most likely source of the

patient’s hyponatremia?
@ ©@ Drinking too much water

© Not eating enough sodium
© Taking long-term corticosteroids

© Taking a dose of diuretics that is too high

That's right!

Rationale

Psychogenic polydipsia is a condition caused by antipsychotics. It causes dry mouth. People who have
psychogenic polydipsia usually consume an excessive amount of water at a rapid rate. The body cannot correct
for the acute dilation of the blood, and hyponatremia ensues. Consuming too little sodium may lead to
hyponatremia, but because the patient has a history of psychogenic polydipsia, the most likely cause is
consuming too much water. Long-term corticosteroid use increases the excretion of potassium, not sodium.
Taking too high a dose of diuretics can also lead to hypokalemia, but there is no indication that the patient is

taking a diuretic.

p.141
Question 20

Water forms the basis of which type of body fluid that is also composed of potassium and
phosphates?

tx} © Interstitial fluids

O Extrastitial fluids

ivy) O Intracellular fluids

O Extracellular fluids

So close!

Rationale

Intracellular fluids (within the cell) are composed of water plus concentrations of potassium and phosphates.
Interstitial fluids (between the cells) contain concentrations of sodium and chloride. Extrastitial is not a type of
body fluid. Extracellular fluids (outside the cell) consist of interstitial fluids and encompass all fluids outside

cells, including plasma and the watery components of body organs and substances.

pp. 143-144
Question 21

What food group is most important to consume while taking thiazide diuretics?

© @ Whole grains

© Beans and legumes
@ © Fruits and vegetables

© Dairy and animal protein

So close!

Rationale

Taking thiazide diuretics causes excess loss of minerals, including potassium, along with fluid excretion
through urine. Anyone taking these medications should increase the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables in
their diets and eat other foods that are good sources of potassium. Whole grains, beans and legumes, and
dairy and animal protein would be less beneficial for this purpose.

p.141
Question 22

If the extracellular fluid contains a 10% glucose solution and the intracellular fluid contains

a 20% glucose solution, what effect will the force of osmosis exert?

© Movement of electrolytes out of the cell
@ @ Movement of water molecules into the cell
© Maintenance of existing glucose distribution

O Movement of water molecules out of the cell

That's right!

Rationale

Osmosis is the force that moves water molecules from an area of greater concentration of water molecules
(ie., with fewer particles in a solution) to an area of lesser concentration of water molecules (i.e., with more
particles in a solution) to equalize the solution on both sides. In this example, osmosis would move water into
the cell, where the concentration of the glucose solute is higher. Osmosis would also move glucose, but not
electrolytes, out of the cell. It would not maintain the disequilibrium nor would it move water out of the cell.

Test-Taking Tip: Do not worry if you select the same numbered answer repeatedly because there usually is no

pattern to the answers.

Question 23

How are electrolytes measured?

© According to the total weight of particles in solution
© According to the average size of particles in solution
@ ©@ According to the number of ionic charges in a solution

© According to the average weight of particles in solution

That's right!

Rationale
Electrolytes are measured according to the number of ionic charges, or electrovalent bonds in a solution. They
are not measured according to total weight, average size, or average weight of particles in solution.

Question 24

In which clinical situation would glucose influence the movement of water in and out of
fluid compartments?

O Diuretic use
© Reactive hypoglycemia
© High-carbohydrate diet
@ @ Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

That's right!

Rationale

Glucose is a small organic compound that diffuses freely in and out of the various fluid compartments but
does not influence the movement of water unless present in abnormally large concentrations. Such a situation
occurs in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or when large amounts of glucose being excreted in
the urine cause an abnormal osmotic diuresis or excess water output. This would not result from diuretic use,
reactive hypoglycemia, or a high-carbohydrate diet in the absence of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,
based on this, what you would give as the answer. After you have taken a few seconds to do this, then look at
all of the choices and select the one that most nearly matches the answer you recalled. It is important that you
consider all the choices and not just choose the first option that seems to fit the answer you recall. Remember
the distractors. The second choice may look okay, but the fourth choice may be worded in a way that makes it
a slightly better choice. If you do not weigh all the choices, you are not maximizing your chances of correctly
answering each question.

Question 25

How do plasma proteins maintain vascular blood volume?

© By signaling the thirst mechanism
@ @ By exerting colloidal osmotic pressure
© By diffusing freely across cell membranes

© By influencing the movement of water in and out of veins

That's right!

Rationale

Plasma proteins exert colloidal osmotic pressure to maintain vascular blood volume. Plasma proteins do not
signal the thirst mechanism. Due to their large size, plasma proteins cannot diffuse freely across cell
membranes. Plasma proteins influence the movement of water in and out of capillaries, not veins.

p.145
Question 26

What is the adequate intake (Al) recommendation of daily total water for men 19 and older?

So close!

Rationale

The Al recommendation for total water is about 3.7 L/day for men over 19 years of age. Intakes of 2.7 L is the
Al recommendation for total water for women age 19 years or older. Intakes of 1.7 L and 1.3 L are too low for

men ages 19 years or older but more suitable for males at younger ages.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

Question 27

What is the adequate intake (Al) recommendation of daily total water during pregnancy?

O O7L
@0O2
O 23L
© @ 3.8L

So close!

Rationale

The Al recommendation for daily total water is about 3 L/day for pregnant women. A daily total water intake

of 0.7 L or 2.3 Lis too low during pregnancy. The Al recommendation of daily total water for lactating women
is 3.8L.

Question 28

Which is a function of water in the human body? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

© [BB] Insulates body organs
@ [B) Helps regulate body temperature

@ |B] Serves as a lubricant on moving parts of the body
|_| Provides structure to cell membranes

@ [_| Transports nutrients and waste products

So close!

Rationale

In the human body, water helps regulate body temperature, serves as a lubricant on moving parts of the body,
and transports nutrients and waste products. Adipose tissue, not fluid, is largely responsible for insulating
organs. Lipids, not water, provide structure to cell membranes; water provides shape and rigidity to cells.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

pp. 138-139
Question 29

Which reason places older adults at an increased risk for dehydration?
@ ©@ Increased urine volume

© Increased thirst sensation
© Increased fluid reabsorption
© Increased desire to drink fluids when dehydrated

That's right!

Rationale

Dehydration presents special concerns among older adult patients. The hypothalamus is the regulatory center
for thirst, hunger, body temperature, water balance, and blood pressure. Age-associated physiologic changes
to the hypothalamus and renal system, such as an increased urine volume and a decrease in fluid
reabsorption, make the older adult population vulnerable to chronic hypohydration. Older adult individuals
exhibit a decreased thirst sensation and a decreased desire to consume fluids when they are dehydrated;
however, the mechanisms of thirst perception are not clearly defined.

Test-Taking Tip: Multiple-choice questions can be challenging because students think that they will recognize
the right answer when they see it or that the right answer will somehow stand out from the other choices. This
is a dangerous misconception. The more carefully the question is constructed, the more each of the choices
will seem like the correct response.

p.141
Question 30

Which patient is most likely to have increased water needs?

© A 10-year-old who recently broke an arm
@ @ 44-month-old infant who was premature
© A 56-year-old who does not take any medications
© A 25-year-old who reports drinking 100 mg of coffee daily

That's right!

Rationale

The body’s requirement for water varies depending on the environment, activity level, functional level,
metabolic level, age, and dietary influences. Age plays an important role in determining water needs. A high
fluid intake is critical in infancy because the infant's body content of water is particularly high, and a relatively
large amount of this water is outside of the cells. A 10-year-old would not require more water intake based on
having a broken bone. A 56-year-old patient who does not take any medications, such as diuretics, would not
require a greater water intake than an infant. Coffee can act as a diuretic; the effect is usually mild and only
occurs with an intake of greater than or equal to 300 mg.

Question 31

Which factor contributes to increased water needs and is related to environmental

conditions? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Hot, arid temperatures

@ [B) Change in altitude
@ [BB] Freezing cold temperatures

|_| Increased physical activity

|_| Humid, mild temperatures

That's right!

Rationale

Both the external climate and internal heat produced from physical work can increase body temperature. Hot
temperatures in the environment can lead to sweating from an elevated body temperature. Fluid loss through
sweat increases water needs. Altitude and cold temperatures can cause increased respiratory loss, hypoxia, or
cold-induced diuresis, as well as increased energy expenditure, all of which raise water needs. Increased
physical activity increases the body’s water needs, but it is not an environmental factor. Milder temperatures,
even humid environments, do not require increased water needs but may lead to more physical activity, which

would raise needs.

p.139
Question 32

Which function of water in the body is critical for homeostasis? Select all that apply. One,
some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ |B] Sustains body temperature

@ [_| Provides smooth movement of joints

@ [BB] Carries metabolites throughout the body

@ (|B) lonizes and dissolves substances in the body
@ [BB] !s involved in all chemical reactions in the body

So close!

Rationale

Water is the most vital nutrient for humans. Water is necessary to help maintain a stable body temperature. It
also has a lubricating effect on moving parts of the body; for example, fluid in the joints provides smooth
movement and prevents damage from constant friction. Water also circulates throughout the body and carries
nutrients, secretions, and metabolites to meet the needs the body’s cells. The polarity of water effectively
ionizes and dissolves many substances. Water is also the basic liquid solvent for all chemical reactions within

the body.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

pp. 138-139
Question 33

Place the steps of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism in the correct order.

ivy) 1. Renin is released.
ivy) 2. Angiotensinogen is converted.

ivy) Angiotensin | is converted to angiotensin II.
ivy) 4. Aldosterone is released.

5. Sodium is retained.

w

That's right!

Rationale

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is complex. It corrects for hypovolemia through a negative
feedback mechanism. When blood flow volume through the kidneys drops below normal, the kidneys release
the enzyme renin into the blood. Angiotensinogen is produced by the liver. Renin converts angiotensinogen
to angiotensin |. As blood flows through the lungs, an enzyme found on the capillaries called angiotensin-
converting enzyme converts angiotensin | to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II triggers the release of aldosterone.
Aldosterone stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb sodium. This system increases blood volume flow through the
kidneys.

Test-Taking Tip: In this question type, you are asked to prioritize (put in order) the options presented. For
example, you might be asked the steps of performing an action or skill such as those involved in medication
administration.

pp. 148-149.
Question 34

Where are plasma proteins found in the human body?
O Inside cells

© Inside organs
© Inside tissues

ivy) © Inside blood vessels

That's right!

Rationale
Plasma proteins stay inside the blood vessels because protein particles are too large to pass through the pores
of cell membranes. They are not present inside organs or tissues except within blood vessels.

Test-Taking Tip: Make certain that the answer you select is reasonable and obtainable under ordinary

circumstances and that the action can be carried out in the given situation.

Question 35

A 10-month-old infant has been having diarrhea for the past few days. The infant’s parents
call the health care provider and ask what to give the child to eat and drink. The child is
mostly breastfeeding along with solid foods being introduced. Which food will the health
care provider recommend the parents give to the child?

tx} © Rice

So close!

Rationale

Diarrhea is frequently considered a minor condition in developed countries. Children should consume their
regular age-appropriate foods, such as breast milk, breast milk substitute, or solids foods. The BRAT (bananas,
rice, applesauce, tea, and toast) diet does not encompass the typical variety of foods that infants and small
children consume and only worsens the energy and nutrient deficit that occurs with diarrhea and vomiting.

Test-Taking Tip: The most reliable way to ensure that you select the correct response to a multiple-choice
question is to recall it. Depend on your learning and memory to furnish the answer to the question. To do
this, read the stem, and then stop! Do not look at the response options yet. Try to recall what you know and,

Question 36

Why does heavy physical activity increase the human body’s water intake requirements?
Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

© [BB] Physical activity disrupts the thirst mechanism.
@ |B] Water is lost through increased sweat and respiration.
|_|] Water provides energy burned during physical activity.
@ [B] More water is necessary for increased metabolic demands.

|_| Higher muscle mass increases the percentage of body water.

So close!

Rationale

Heavy physical activity increases water requirements for the human body because water is lost through
increased sweat and respiration and because more water is necessary for the increased metabolic demands of

heavy physical activity. Physical activity does not disrupt the thirst mechanism. Water does not provide energy.
Higher muscle mass does not increase the percentage of body water.

Test-Taking Tip: Once you have decided on an answer, look at the stem again. Does your choice answer the
question that was asked? If the question stem asks "why,' be sure the response you have chosen is a reason. If
the question stem is singular, then be sure the option is singular, and the same for plural stems and plural
responses. Many times, checking to make sure that the choice makes sense in relation to the stem will reveal
the correct answer.

p.139
Question 37

From where is water pulled to dilute the concentration of solutes in the bloodstream?
O Skin

GO Cells
O Urine

© @ Kidneys

So close!

Rationale

When the concentration of solutes in the blood increases, the body responds by pulling fluid from the cells
into the bloodstream to dilute it. Fluid is not pulled from skin or kidneys at the organ level, nor is it pulled
from the urine.

p. 144
Question 38

Which term describes the movement of water molecules from an area of low solute

concentration to an area of high solute concentration?

O Passive transport

©) Selective permeability

ivy) © Osmosis

O Diffusion

That's right!

Rationale

The movement of water molecules from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute
concentration is called osmosis. Passive transport describes the movement of particles from an area of higher
concentration to an area of lower concentration and does not require energy expenditure. Selective
permeability describes cellular membranes that only permit certain molecules to cross. Diffusion is the
process in which molecules intermix because of their kinetic energy.

Test-Taking Tip: Identifying content and what is being asked about that content is critical to your choosing the
correct response. Be alert for words in the stem of the item that are the same or similar in nature to those in
one or two of the options.

p.142
Question 39

What is the best description of dehydration?

O Fluid volume excess
© Fluid volume instability
ivy) © Fluid volume deficit

O Fluid volume alterations

That's right!

Rationale

Dehydration is a fluid volume deficit in the body. Dehydration is often associated with vomiting, diarrhea, or
poor oral intake of fluids. Fluid volume excess, or overhydration, describes too much circulating fluid in the
body. Fluid volume instability and fluid volume alterations are vague terms that could be referring to fluid
volume excess or fluid volume deficit.

Question 40

Which is a key function of water? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be

correct.

@ |] Water is necessary to help maintain a stable body temperature.
@ |B] Water acts as a lubricant.
[| Water acts as a solute.

@ |B] Water circulates throughout the body in the form of blood and tissue fluids.

That's right!

Rationale

Water does not act as a solute; on the contrary, it acts as a solvent. Water provides thermoregulation, acts as a
lubricant, and circulates throughout the body in the form of blood and various other secretions and tissue

fluids.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

pp. 138-139
Question 41

Which characteristic of electrolytes enables them to diffuse freely across cell membranes?

@ @ Small size
O Large size
©) Positive charge

© Negative charge

That's right!

Rationale

By virtue of their small size, electrolytes can diffuse freely across cell membranes and create forces that control
the movement of water. A larger size would inhibit this process. Both positively and negatively charged ions
can diffuse across cell membranes; charge does not determine their ability to do so.

Test-Taking Tip: Start by reading each of the answer options carefully. Usually at least one of them will be
clearly wrong. Eliminate this one from consideration. Now you have reduced the number of response choices
by one and improved the odds. Continue to analyze the options. If you can eliminate one more choice in a
four-option question, you have reduced the odds to 50/50. While you are eliminating the wrong choices, recall
often occurs. One of the options may serve as a trigger that causes you to remember what a few seconds ago
had seemed completely forgotten.

p. 143
Question 42

Which mineral acts as a buffer to maintain acid-base balance?
O Carbonic acid

iv) © Bicarbonate

O Carbon dioxide
O Potassium chloride

That's right!

Rationale

The bicarbonate buffer system maintains this essential degree of acidity in the body fluids because the
bicarbonate (base) is approximately 20 times more abundant than the carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is a
chemical compound composed of carbon in water (carbonated water). Carbon dioxide is an acid component
released or retained by the lungs to maintain homeostasis. Potassium chloride is a supplement that can be
used to treat or manage hypokalemia.

Test-Taking Tip: You have at least a 25% chance of selecting the correct response in multiple-choice items. If
you are uncertain about a question, eliminate the choices you believe are wrong, and then call on your
knowledge, skills, and abilities to choose from the remaining responses.

p.150
Question 43

The student nurse is presenting information on compensatory mechanisms of acid-base
balance and homeostasis. Which statement made by the student requires correction?

© "If the body's pH is too high, the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume will decrease."
@ @ "If the body’s pH is too high, the kidneys secrete hydrogen ions."
© "If the body's pH is too low, the kidneys will secrete hydrogen ions.’

© "If the body's pH is too low, the respiratory rate will increase."

That's right!

Rationale

The statement requiring correction is "If the body’s pH is too high, the kidneys secrete hydrogen ions." The
high pH indicates fluids are alkaline. Hydrogen ion secretion is not a compensatory response because
secretion would worsen the alkalinity of the fluids. If the body’s pH is too high, the respiratory rate and/or
tidal volume will decrease to retain acidic carbon dioxide and restore the body’s pH. If the body’s pH is too
low, the kidneys will secrete hydrogen ions to restore alkalinity. If the pH is too low, the respiratory rate will
increase to release acidic carbon dioxide and restore the pH.

p.150
Question 44

Which electrolyte is a cation? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

|_| Sulfate
@ |B] Sodium
@ |B) Chloride
@ |B] Potassium

[|_| Phosphate

iv) [ml] Magnesium

So close!

Rationale

Sodium, potassium, and magnesium are cations. Sulfate, chloride, and phosphate are anions.

p. 143
Question 45

Which brain structure undergoes physiologic changes with aging, putting older adults at a
higher risk for dehydration?

© Kidneys
O Adrenals
O Thalamus

@ ©@ Hypothalamus

That's right!

Rationale

The hypothalamus is the regulatory center for thirst, hunger, body temperature, water balance, and blood
pressure. Age-associated physiologic changes to the hypothalamus and renal system can cause elderly
individuals to have overall decreased thirst sensation and reduced fluid intake when they are dehydrated
compared with younger adults. The kidneys and adrenals are not brain structures. The thalamus does not
regulate thirst and water balance.

Test-Taking Tip: Read the question carefully before looking at the answers: (1) determine what the question is
really asking, and look for key words; (2) read each answer thoroughly, and see if it completely covers the
material the question asks; and (3) narrow the choices by immediately eliminating answers you know are
incorrect.

p.141
Question 46

What is the effect of ingesting 300 mg or more of caffeine at one time?
©) Dehydration

iv) © Acute diuretic effect
O Net loss of total body fluid

O Diminished effect over time

That's right!

Rationale

The consumption of 300 mg or more of caffeine at one time has an acute diuretic effect. The result does not
appear to be dehydration or a loss in total body fluid. The routine intake of caffeine diminishes its effect over

time, but this is not an effect of consuming 300 mg or more of caffeine at one time.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details. Details provided in the stem of the item, such as behavioral changes or
clinical changes (or both) within a certain time period, can provide a clue to the most appropriate response or, in
some cases, responses.

p. 140
Question 47

How much water is generally required for the metabolism of every 1000 kcal consumed?

@ @ 1000 mL

That's right!

Rationale

Metabolic processes require water. A general rule is that approximately 1000 mL of water is necessary for the
metabolism of every 1000 kcal consumed. Water intake of 100, 250, or 500 mL is insufficient to metabolize

every 1000 kcal consumed.

p. 140
Question 48

Which electrolyte is an anion? Select all that apply. One, some, or all responses may be
correct.

iv) [ml] Chloride

[| Potassium

@ |B] Phosphate

[| Magnesium

That's right!

Rationale

Sulfate, chloride, and phosphate are anions. Sodium, potassium, and magnesium are cations.

p. 143
Question 49

Which food has a water content of 90% or higher? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

[| Apple

[| Carrot

|_| Potatoes
@ [B] Lettuce
@ [B) Cantaloupe
@ [B) Squash

That's right!

Rationale

Lettuce contains 96% water, cantaloupe contain 90% water, and squash contain 94% water. Apples contain
86% water. Carrots contain 88% water. Potatoes contain 62% water.

p. 144
Question 50

Which factor is a cause of respiratory acidosis?

O Extensive vomiting
© Hyperventilation
@ ©@ Accumulation of carbon dioxide

© Significant loss of bicarbonate

That's right!

Rationale

Respiratory acidosis is caused by an accumulation of carbon dioxide (an acid). Extensive vomiting can result in
metabolic alkalosis as a significant amount of hydrochloric acid is lost and bicarbonate (a base) is secreted.
Hyperventilation can lead to respiratory alkalosis. Significant loss of bicarbonate (a base) can lead to metabolic
acidosis.

Test-Taking Tip: Because few things in life are absolute without exceptions, avoid selecting answers that
include words such as always, never, all, every, and none. Answers containing these key words are rarely correct.

p.150
Question 51

Which pH value would indicate that the substance is acidic? Select all that apply. One,

some, or all responses may be correct.

Te

That's right!

Rationale
Substances with a pH of less than 7 are acidic. Therefore substances with pH of 0 and 4 are acidic. A pH of 7
indicates that the substance is neutral and is neither an acid nor a base. Substances with a pH of more than 7

are alkaline. Therefore substances with pH of 10 and 14 are alkaline.

p.150
Question 52

Which term refers to a hormone of the pituitary gland that acts on the distal nephron
tubule to conserve water by reabsorption and is also known as antidiuretic hormone?

iv) © Vasopressin

O Angiotensin |
O Angiotensin II

O Aldosterone

That's right!

Rationale

Vasopressin is a hormone of the pituitary gland that acts on the distal nephron tubule to conserve water by
reabsorption and is also known as antidiuretic hormone. Angiotensin | is an inactive peptide hormone that is
the precursor to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is an active hormone that constricts blood vessels and
stimulates the release of aldosterone. Both actions lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone a
hormone of the adrenal glands that acts on the distal nephron tubule to stimulate the reabsorption of sodium
in an ion exchange with potassium; the aldosterone mechanism is essentially a sodium-conserving
mechanism, but it also indirectly conserves water because water absorption follows sodium resorption.

p. 148
Question 53

Which mechanism does the body use to maintain a constant flow of fluid through the
tissues and carry materials to and from the cells? Select all that apply. One, some, or all
responses may be correct.

iv) [ml] Hydrostatic pressure
@ [BB] Colloidal osmotic pressure

[|_| Chemical buffer system
|__| Physiologic buffer system

© [] Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

So close!

Rationale

The body maintains this constant flow of fluid through the tissues and carries materials to and from the cells
by means of hydrostatic pressure and colloidal osmotic pressure. Chemical and physiologic buffer systems
and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are not directly involved in maintaining a constant flow of fluid
through the tissues and carries materials to and from the cells. Chemical and physiologic buffer systems are
important mechanisms for maintaining the blood pH within an acceptable range for life. The renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system is a complex hormonal system that corrects for hypovolemia through a
negative feedback mechanism.

p.146
Question 54

Which process involves movement of water and solutes across membrane with assistance

from cell membrane transporters?
© Diffusion

O Osmosis

ivy) © Facilitated diffusion
O Pinocytosis

That's right!

Rationale

In facilitated diffusion, membrane transporters assist particles with the crossing of the membrane. Cell
membrane transporters are not involved in diffusion, osmosis, or pinocytosis. In simple diffusion, particles
move outward in all directions from an area of greater concentration of particles to an area of lesser
concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area with a low solute concentration to
an area with a high solute concentration. In pinocytosis, large molecules attach themselves to the cell
membrane, whereby the cell engulfs them encased in a vacuole. In this cavity, nutrient particles are carried
across the cell membrane and into the cell. Once inside the cell, the vacuole opens, and cell enzymes

metabolize the particles.

Test-Taking Tip: Attempt to select the answer that is most complete and includes the other answers within it.
For example, a stem might read, "A child's intelligence is influenced by what?" and three options might be
genetic inheritance, environmental factors, and past experiences. The fourth option might be multiple factors,

which is a more inclusive choice and therefore the correct answer.

Question 55

Which particle is too large to pass through the walls of capillaries?
© Water molecule

© Electrolytes
O Nutrient constituents

@ ©@ Plasma protein molecule

That's right!

Rationale

The walls of capillaries are thin and porous. Larger particles such as plasma protein molecules cannot pass
through the small pores of the capillary membrane. Water molecules and small particles, including
electrolytes and various nutrient constituents, can move freely through the capillary membrane.

Question 56

Which large molecular size organic compound is responsible for maintaining integrity of
the blood volume by exerting colloidal osmotic pressure (COP)?

That's right!

Rationale

Plasma proteins (called colloids) exert COP to maintain the integrity of the blood volume. Glucose, anions, and
cations are not responsible for maintaining integrity of the blood volume by exerting colloidal osmotic
pressure. Glucose are small organic compounds that produce movement of water in uncharacteristic high
concentration scenarios. Cations and anions are electrolytes that maintain electrical neutrality.

Question 57

Which output route is responsible for the largest amount of water exiting from the body?

That's right!

Rationale

Water leaves the body through the kidneys, skin, lungs, and feces. Of these output routes, the largest amount
of water exits through the kidneys. The output of water by the kidneys is 1400 mL/day. In contrast, the output
of water by lungs is 350 mL/day, output of water by anus is 200 mL/day, and the output of water by sweat is
100 mL/day.

Question 58

Which percentage represents the total body water outside of the cells? Select all that apply.
One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

@ [| 20% of total body weight

@ [| 34% of total body water
|_| 35% of total body weight

© [B] 45% of total body weight
|_| 66% of total body water

So close!

Rationale

Extracellular fluid (ECF), the total body water outside of the cell, collectively makes up approximately 20% of
the total body weight and 34% of the total body water. ECF does not account for 35% or 45% of total body
weight or 66% of total body water.

Test-Taking Tip: Be alert for details about what you are being asked to do. In this question type, you are asked
to select all options that apply to a given situation or patient. All options likely relate to the situation, but only
some of the options may relate directly to the situation.

Question 59

Which factor can make older adults vulnerable to chronic hypohydration? Select all that

apply. One, some, or all responses may be correct.

Some correct answers were not selected

|_| Polydipsia
@ [BB] Physiologic changes to the hypothalamus
iv) [ml] Increase in urine volume

@ [| Decrease in fluid resorption
|_| Psychotropic drugs

So close!

Rationale

Dehydration presents special concerns among older adults. Age-associated physiologic changes to the
hypothalamus and renal system, such as an increase in urine volume and decrease in fluid resorption, coupled
with a decline in fluid intake, make this population vulnerable to chronic hypohydration. Polydipsia, or
excessive thirst and drinking, and psychotropic drugs are risk factors for water intoxication, not dehydration.

Question 60

Which factor makes high fluid intake critical during infancy?
© Breast milk has a diuretic effect.

@ © An infant’s body content of water is particularly high.
© A relatively large amount of an infant's body water is inside of the cells.

© Infants are prone to diseases.

That's right!

Rationale

High fluid intake (via breast milk or breast milk substitute) is critical during infancy because an infant’s body
content of water is particularly high (approximately 70% to 75% of their total body weight) and because a
relatively large amount of this body water is outside of the cells and thus is more easily lost. Breast milk does
not have a diuretic effect. A relatively large amount of an infant’s body water is outside of the cells. Infants
being prone to diseases is not a factor that makes high fluid intake critical during infancy.
