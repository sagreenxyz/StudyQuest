This lattice is too large to diffuse through the agar gel, so the arc remains visible."},{id:"mcb_ch20_019",type:"multiple-choice",subject:"Microbiology",chapter:"20",topic:"Diagnostic Immunology",difficulty:"Medium",question:"We use antisera to distinguish between various ________ within a species of bacteria.",options:["isotypes","lines","subspecies","serovars"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Antisera are used to differentiate between serovars, which are distinct variations within a species of bacteria based on their surface antigens."},{id:"mcb_ch20_020",type:"multiple-choice",subject:"Microbiology",chapter:"20",topic:"Diagnostic Immunology",difficulty:"Medium",question:"Why would a spectrophotometer be helpful in interpreting the results of a sandwich ELISA?",options:["It would allow for visualization of the antibody-antigen complex.","It would be faster, although less sensitive.","It would provide more information because the absorbance measured would be proportional to the amount of antigen in the wells.","It would allow one to use a single test to differentiate previous exposure from acute infection."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"In a sandwich ELISA, the amount of colored product produced is proportional to the amount of antigen in the sample. A spectrophotometer can be used to measure the absorbance of the colored product, which provides a quantitative measure of the antigen concentration."}],a={name:e,description:t,subject:i,questions:o};export{a as default,t as description,e as name,o as questions,i as subject};
