Gastric emptying is decreased by more soluble dietary fibers, thus slowing digestion, which could exacerbate constipation. Soluble dietary fibers do bind minerals, lipids, and bile acids, thus increasing the excretion of each, but this does not directly address constipation. Normal microflora in the colon use dietary fiber as a medium for microbial fermentation, leading to synthesis of vitamins and formation of short-chain fatty acids to help to maintain the health of the colon, but this statement does not specifically address constipation."},{id:"nutrition-ch2-054",type:"multiple-choice",subject:"Nutrition",chapter:"Chapter 2",topic:"Dietary Fiber and Glucose",difficulty:"medium",question:"Which statement best describes the relationship between dietary fiber and glucose levels?",options:["Eating dietary fibers may help slow the absorption of glucose by my body.","Eating more high-fiber foods helps me feel fuller; thus, I will eat less sugary foods.","Fiber-containing foods may lower the availability of minerals, which can decrease glucose breakdown for me.","Replacing high-fat foods with high-fiber foods helps decrease glucose levels in general."],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"Dietary fiber, such as soluble fiber, may cause slower absorption of glucose, thus helping keep blood glucose levels within acceptable parameters. Increased consumption of high-fiber foods can help an individual feel fuller but does not describe the relationship between dietary fiber and glucose. Fiber-containing foods may bind minerals and lower their bioavailability, but this does not describe the relationship between dietary fiber and glucose.
