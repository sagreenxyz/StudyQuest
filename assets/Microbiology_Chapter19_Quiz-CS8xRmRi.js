Which blood type is the universal donor, the donor that can successfully donate blood to any recipient?",options:["Type B","Type A","Type AB","Type O"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Type O blood is the universal donor because the red blood cells have no A or B antigens on their surface, so they do not elicit an immune response in recipients with other blood types."},{id:"mcb_ch19_017",type:"multiple-choice",subject:"Microbiology",chapter:"19",topic:"Disorders of the Immune System",difficulty:"Medium",question:"Inflammatory molecules are released by mast cells in type I hypersensitivities; type II hypersensitivities, however, are characterized by which of the following?",options:["localized tissue reactions, such as hives","leukotriene release upon stimulation","strong antibody reactions against antigens","cell lysis (cytotoxicity)"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"Type II hypersensitivities are characterized by cell lysis (cytotoxicity), which is the destruction of cells targeted by antibodies."},{id:"mcb_ch19_018",type:"multiple-choice",subject:"Microbiology",chapter:"19",topic:"Disorders of the Immune System",difficulty:"Medium",question:"An immune complex is an aggregate of which of the following?",options:["antigen molecules","antibody and antigen molecules","antibody molecules","histamine molecules"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"An immune complex is a molecule formed from the binding of an antibody to a soluble antigen."},{id:"mcb_ch19_019",type:"multiple-choice",subject:"Microbiology",chapter:"19",topic:"Disorders of the Immune System",difficulty:"Medium",question:"Which of the following is a true statement?",options:["Opsonization of red blood cells occurs after phagocytosis.","Systemic anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity caused by the release of cytokines by TH1 cells.","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis can be a type III or type IV hypersensitivity, depending on whether immune complexes accumulate.","IgE molecules have three Fab sites to which allergens can bind."],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an inflammation of the lungs due to a hypersensitivity reaction to inhaled dusts, fungi, or molds.

Therefore, the same immune responses that are protective against helminths can also cause allergic reactions."}],s={name:e,description:i,subject:t,questions:o};export{s as default,i as description,e as name,o as questions,t as subject};
