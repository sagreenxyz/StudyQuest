What is the purpose of this alcohol treatment?",options:["It makes holes in the cell membrane large enough for antibodies to pass.","It makes the membrane sticky so antibodies will bind and be taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis.","It removes negative charges from the membrane, which would otherwise repulse the antibodies.","It prevents nonspecific binding of the antibodies to the cell membrane."],correctAnswer:0,explanation:"Alcohol is used to permeabilize the cell membrane, allowing antibodies to enter the cell and bind to intracellular targets."},{id:"mic-20-13",type:"multiple-choice",subject:"Microbiology",topic:"Laboratory Analysis of the Immune Response",chapter:20,difficulty:"easy",question:"In a lateral-flow pregnancy test, you see a blue band form on the control line and no band form on the test line.
