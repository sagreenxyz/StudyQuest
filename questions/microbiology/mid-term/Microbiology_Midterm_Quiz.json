      "options": ["dehydrated", "stained", "hydrated", "fixed"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Dehydration, typically using a graded series of alcohol, is essential to remove water from specimens before they can be embedded in resin for TEM. This prevents water from interfering with the embedding process and the electron beam.",

      "options": ["parasitic", "mutualistic", "commensal", "symbiotic"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A parasitic relationship is one where one organism (the parasite, e.g., pathogenic bacteria) benefits at the expense of the other (the host, e.g., humans). Mutualism benefits both, commensalism benefits one with no effect on the other, and symbiosis is a general term for close relationships.",
