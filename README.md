## üìÅ Project File Structure

StudyQuest loads question files directly from your project structure:

### Adding Question Files

1. Create JSON question files following the format described below
2. Place them in the `public/questions/` directory
3. Files can be organized in subdirectories for better organization
4. Refresh the page to load new files

### Example Structure

```
public/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ questions/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ biology/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapter-1.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chapter-2.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chemistry/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ basics.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ organic.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ physics/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mechanics.json
```

### Sample Files Included

The project includes two sample question files:

- `public/questions/tests/sample-biology.json` - Basic biology concepts
- `public/questions/tests/sample-chemistry.json` - Chemistry fundamentals

These demonstrate the question format and are loaded automatically.

## üìö Question File Format

## üß† Learning Algorithms

### Spaced Repetition (SM-2 Algorithm)
StudyQuest uses a configurable SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm for optimal retention:

- **First correct answer**: Review in 24 hours (configurable)
- **Second correct answer**: Review in 6 days (configurable)
- **Subsequent correct answers**: Interval increases based on ease factor
- **Incorrect answers**: Reset progress and review in 1 hour (configurable)
- **Ease factor**: Adjusts based on performance (increases with correct answers, decreases with incorrect ones)
- **Mastery threshold**: Questions are considered mastered after 3 consecutive correct answers (configurable)

### Customizable Settings
- **Review Timing**: Adjust when questions appear for first, second, and incorrect reviews
- **Mastery Criteria**: Set how many consecutive correct answers constitute mastery
- **Ease Factors**: Fine-tune how question difficulty adapts to your performance
- **Presets**: Choose from Intensive, Balanced, or Thorough learning schedules

### Practice All Questions Mode
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes every question in your dataset
- **Random Order**: Questions are shuffled to prevent pattern memorization
- **No Limits**: Unlike spaced repetition, this mode doesn't limit based on review schedules
- **Perfect for**: Exam preparation, comprehensive review, or when you want to practice everything

## üìä Progress Tracking

The application tracks:
- **Total questions** loaded from project files
- **Questions studied** (attempted at least once)
- **Mastered questions** (answered correctly based on mastery threshold)
- **Questions due for review** based on spaced repetition
- **Subject-wise progress** with visual progress bars
- **Topic-wise progress** with detailed breakdowns
- **Recent activity** showing your latest study sessions

## üé® Design Philosophy

StudyQuest follows modern design principles:
- **Clean, minimalist interface** that focuses on content
- **Consistent color system** with semantic meaning
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Accessibility first** with proper contrast ratios and alt text
- **Smooth animations** that enhance user experience
- **Progressive disclosure** to manage complexity

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage with automatic date parsing
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support

## üîß Configuration

### Vite Configuration

The application is configured to work with GitHub Pages deployment:

```javascript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/StudyQuest/',
  plugins: [react()],
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['lucide-react'],
  },
});
```

### File Loading

Questions are loaded using Vite's `import.meta.glob` feature to discover all JSON files in the `public/questions/` directory and its subdirectories.

## üöÄ Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The application is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` directory to GitHub Pages
3. The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles automatic deployment

### Other Platforms

For other deployment platforms, you may need to adjust the `base` path in `vite.config.ts`:

```javascript
// For root domain deployment
base: '/',

// For subdirectory deployment
base: '/your-subdirectory/',
```

## üìù Best Practices

### Question Creation
1. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for IDs and topics
2. **Clear Topics**: Make topics specific enough to be meaningful but broad enough to group related questions
3. **Balanced Difficulty**: Include questions of varying difficulty levels
4. **Quality Images**: Use high-quality, relevant images with descriptive alt text
5. **Comprehensive Explanations**: Provide detailed explanations for complex questions

### File Organization
6. **Logical Grouping**: Group related questions by subject and topic in separate files
7. **Unique IDs**: Ensure all question IDs are unique across your question sets
8. **Meaningful Facts**: For fact cards, include interesting, educational, and memorable information
9. **Balanced Matching**: Create matching questions with 3-6 pairs for optimal difficulty
10. **Source Attribution**: Include sources for fact cards to build credibility

### Technical
11. **Valid JSON**: Always validate JSON syntax before adding files
12. **Image Accessibility**: Use external URLs for images and provide meaningful alt text
13. **Reasonable File Sizes**: Keep JSON files manageable (under 1MB recommended)
14. **Backup Copies**: Maintain backup copies of your question files
15. **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes to your question files

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Questions not loading**: Check that JSON files are in `public/questions/` and have valid syntax
2. **Images not displaying**: Verify image URLs are accessible and use proper formats
3. **Progress not saving**: Check browser localStorage quota and clear data if needed
4. **Validation errors**: Ensure all required fields are present for each question type

### File Validation

The application validates:
- Required fields for each question type
- Correct answer indices for multiple choice and select-all questions
- True/False questions have exactly `["True", "False"]` options
- Matching questions have at least 2 pairs with term and definition
- JSON syntax and structure

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Export/import progress data
- Study streak tracking
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Audio support for questions
- Offline mode with service workers
- Question difficulty adjustment based on performance
- Study session scheduling
- Performance comparison over time
- Collaborative question creation tools
