```json
{
  "name": "Chapter 1 - Introduction to Biology",
  "description": "Basic concepts and terminology",
  "subject": "Biology",
  "questions": [
    // Questions go here
  ]
}
```

## üß† Learning Algorithms

### Spaced Repetition (SM-2 Algorithm)
StudyQuest uses a modified SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm for optimal retention:

- **First correct answer**: Review in 1 day
- **Second correct answer**: Review in 6 days
- **Subsequent correct answers**: Interval increases based on ease factor
- **Incorrect answers**: Reset progress and review in 1 hour
- **Ease factor**: Adjusts based on performance (increases with correct answers, decreases with incorrect ones)

### Practice All Questions Mode
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes every question in your dataset
- **Random Order**: Questions are shuffled to prevent pattern memorization
- **No Limits**: Unlike spaced repetition, this mode doesn't limit based on review schedules
- **Perfect for**: Exam preparation, comprehensive review, or when you want to practice everything

## üìä Progress Tracking

The application tracks:
- **Total questions** loaded
- **Questions studied** (attempted at least once)
- **Mastered questions** (answered correctly 3+ times)
- **Questions due for review** based on spaced repetition
- **Subject-wise progress** with visual progress bars
- **Recent activity** showing your latest study sessions

## üé® Design Philosophy

StudyQuest follows modern design principles:
- **Clean, minimalist interface** that focuses on content
- **Consistent color system** with semantic meaning
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Accessibility first** with proper contrast ratios and alt text
- **Smooth animations** that enhance user experience
- **Progressive disclosure** to manage complexity

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage with automatic date parsing
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
