## üìÅ Project File Structure

StudyQuest now supports loading question files directly from your project structure in addition to uploading files. This is useful for:

- **Development**: Include sample questions with your project
- **Distribution**: Ship pre-built question sets
- **Version Control**: Track question files alongside your code

### Adding Project Files

1. Create a `public/questions/` directory in your project
2. Add JSON question files following the same format as uploaded files
3. Files will be automatically discovered and available in the "Project Files" tab

### Example Structure

```
public/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ questions/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ biology-chapter-1.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chemistry-basics.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ physics-mechanics.json
```

### Sample Files Included

The project includes two sample question files:

- `public/questions/sample-biology.json` - Basic biology concepts
- `public/questions/sample-chemistry.json` - Chemistry fundamentals

These demonstrate the question format and can be loaded immediately to test the application.

### File Loading Options

StudyQuest provides two ways to load questions:

1. **Upload Files**: Traditional file upload from your computer
2. **Project Files**: Load from the `public/questions/` directory

Both methods support:
- Multiple file selection
- Duplicate question ID detection
- Comprehensive validation
- Progress tracking
- File management (delete/re-upload)

## üß† Learning Algorithms

### Spaced Repetition (SM-2 Algorithm)
StudyQuest uses a configurable SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm for optimal retention:

- **First correct answer**: Review in 24 hours (configurable)
- **Second correct answer**: Review in 6 days (configurable)
- **Subsequent correct answers**: Interval increases based on ease factor
- **Incorrect answers**: Reset progress and review in 1 hour (configurable)
- **Ease factor**: Adjusts based on performance (increases with correct answers, decreases with incorrect ones)
- **Mastery threshold**: Questions are considered mastered after 3 consecutive correct answers (configurable)

### Customizable Settings
- **Review Timing**: Adjust when questions appear for first, second, and incorrect reviews
- **Mastery Criteria**: Set how many consecutive correct answers constitute mastery
- **Ease Factors**: Fine-tune how question difficulty adapts to your performance
- **Presets**: Choose from Intensive, Balanced, or Thorough learning schedules

### Practice All Questions Mode
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes every question in your dataset
- **Random Order**: Questions are shuffled to prevent pattern memorization
- **No Limits**: Unlike spaced repetition, this mode doesn't limit based on review schedules
- **Perfect for**: Exam preparation, comprehensive review, or when you want to practice everything

## üìä Progress Tracking

The application tracks:
- **Total questions** loaded from all files
- **Questions studied** (attempted at least once)
- **Mastered questions** (answered correctly based on mastery threshold)
- **Questions due for review** based on spaced repetition
- **Subject-wise progress** with visual progress bars
- **Topic-wise progress** with detailed breakdowns
- **File-wise statistics** showing progress per uploaded file
- **Recent activity** showing your latest study sessions

## üé® Design Philosophy

StudyQuest follows modern design principles:
- **Clean, minimalist interface** that focuses on content
- **Consistent color system** with semantic meaning
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Accessibility first** with proper contrast ratios and alt text
- **Smooth animations** that enhance user experience
- **Progressive disclosure** to manage complexity

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage with automatic date parsing
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
